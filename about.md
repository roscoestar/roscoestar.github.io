Welcome! This is a blog about vertebrate paleontology, mostly, focusing on dinosaurs but also covering other topics such as evolution, taxonomy, geology, taphonomy, and pop culture, to name a few. If you see bolded words in a post, that means you can find a brief definition of that word in the [Glossary](https://obscuredinosaurfacts.com/blog/post/2019/09/04/glossary.html).

My background is in mechanical engineering, but I'm an amateur paleoartist and longtime dinosaur fanatic.  New posts go up every other Wednesday.

I have a few items available to buy:
