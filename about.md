Welcome! This is a blog about vertebrate paleontology, mostly, focusing on dinosaurs but also covering other topics such as evolution, taxonomy, geology, taphonomy, and pop culture, to name a few. If you see bolded words in a post, that means you can find a brief definition of that word in the Glossary.

My background is in mechanical engineering, but I'm an amateur paleoartist and longtime dinosaur fanatic.

New posts will now go up every other Wednesday.
