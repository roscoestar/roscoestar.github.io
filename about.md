Welcome! This is a blog about vertebrate paleontology, mostly, focusing on dinosaurs but also covering other topics such as evolution, taxonomy, geology, taphonomy, and pop culture, to name a few. If you see bolded words in a post, that means you can find a brief definition of that word in the Glossary.

My background is in mechanical engineering, but I'm an amateur paleoartist and longtime dinosaur fanatic.

I used to post new content to this blog whenever I had some to post, but from now on I'm going to try to post every Wednesday.
