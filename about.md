Welcome!  This is a blog about vertebrate paleontology, mostly, focusing on dinosaurs but also covering other topics such as evolution, taxonomy, geology, taphonomy, and pop culture, to name a few.  If you see bolded words in a post, that means you can find a brief definition of that word in the Glossary.
