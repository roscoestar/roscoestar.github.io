### ix. Uriel, Part 3

*This is a continuation of one of the stories in my previous two creative writing posts. If you haven't read those (or forgot what happened), I'd recommend going back to read [Part 1](https://obscuredinosaurfacts.com/blog/post/2021/02/24/creative.html) and [Part 2](https://obscuredinosaurfacts.com/blog/post/2022/06/22/creative2.html) and Ctrl-F'ing for "Uriel" before continuing. I've written a lot more than this and plan to attempt to publish it, but here's a blog-post-length sneak peek.*

#### III. T+3.12 years
![turkey](/assets/images/posts/turkey-uriel.png)

"Sir, I have a surprise for you," said Uriel.

I raised my eyebrows. "Oh yeah?" The last time Uriel had surprised me had been about a year ago, when he'd revealed the second pasture and brought in Paola. I wondered if it was possible for this surprise to be equally life-changing.

"Please go to your quarters. You will see that a new area is available."

Paola and I quickly got up from where we'd been sitting in the grass and ran into my quarters, which we hadn't been using very much since I moved my bed into hers. It took me a second to spot the change. In one corner, a floor panel had slid aside, revealing a ladder going down. The last time Uriel opened a new section of the ship, I had checked all the other walls for similar hidden doors, but I hadn't thought to check the floor.

"Uriel! What's down there?" Paola demanded.

"A medical bay, a swimming pool, and much more," Uriel said. "I suggest you go and see."

I smiled and shrugged at Paola, who still looked a bit apprehensive, and headed down the ladder. I guessed I had more faith in Uriel's goodness than she did. Then again, she wasn't the one he was explicitly looking out for.

I descended about thirty feet, arriving, as promised, at the short edge of a swimming pool. I heard Paola scrambling down behind me. On one side of the pool was a closed door labeled MEDICAL, and on the side farthest from us was an open set of double doors that appeared to lead "outside". Paola came up beside me and we exchanged a glance, then started walking toward the double doors together.

My heart was pounding with excitement as the scene came into view. It was a forest. There were quite a few different types of trees--redwood, birch, chestnut, and peach trees were all visible from where I was standing, and berry bushes and hazelnut shrubs grew in between. Nettles, wild garlic, and mushrooms poked plentifully out of the leaf litter. None of the trees were very large, with the tallest reaching only halfway to the high ceiling, but they all looked healthy, and some were supported by plastic rods. The air smelled mulchy and sweet, and I heard what sounded like a turkey gobble in the distance.

Paola noticed the rods too, and pointed at one. She whispered sharply, "John. Do you think there's someone else in here?"

I was about to say something when Uriel interrupted. "Yes, Paola. They are on their way to you now. I think you will like them a lot."

They! More than one new person? That would be at least tripling the number of people I'd seen in the past three years. Paola took my hand and gripped it. I squeezed back, then put my arm around her shoulder in a side-hug and patted her reassuringly. I murmured, "The last time something like this happened, he wasn't wrong." She looked up at me and smiled briefly, then resumed looking around restlessly. The turkey gobbled again. A strange sound to encounter on a spaceship, one might think, but I wasn't surprised by anything Uriel cooked up at this point.

Finally, I heard crunching footsteps approaching. Between the trees, I could see two people approaching, also holding hands. They were an older Asian couple, wearing lumberjack-like flannel and denim. They were smiling brightly at us and didn't seem nervous at all.

"It's great to finally meet you, John and Paola," said the woman. "I'm Valerie. This is Dave." We all shook hands. "Welcome to our neck of the woods."

"Nice to meet you too," I said. "I'm sorry, but it seems like you know more about us than we do about you."

They were a couple of Canadian park rangers who hadn't left behind any friends or family to speak of (as expected, given they were here), who'd been sustaining themselves by trapping, fishing, and foraging long before the apocalypse. When the government money stopped coming, they continued right on as they had been, minus the patrols and border vista maintenance. As we walked through the woods, Valerie explained how, when they'd woken up about a year ago, this space had been an empty white warehouse with a bunch of little balled-and-burlapped saplings, huge mounds of dirt, and some basic equipment like a tractor and a backhoe. I didn't interrupt, but thought it was somewhat unfair that Uriel hadn't given me anything bigger than a shovel to use in preparing Paola's pasture. Valerie and Dave had spent the year turning the place into this beautiful young forest. Dave was nodding along and said "Oh, yes" whenever Valerie stopped to ask, "Isn't that right, dear?".

"There are even rabbits and turkeys that live here," she was saying. "They just appeared when the forest was ready for them, I guess. The foraging is incredible now, especially since everything is edible, even the white mushrooms. At first we were pretty cagey aboot those, but eventually Uriel convinced us to try them."

After crossing a length of forest equivalent to two pastures, we reached the wall that was contiguous with the outside of Paola's quarters upstairs. They'd covered it with slats of redwood, giving it a rustic look. Dave held the door open for us, and we entered their quarters. As I'd expected, it was the same layout as Paola's, with an exercise room, a bedroom with a king-sized bed and a dumbwaiter, a closet, and a bathroom. What I hadn't expected was the window on the floor, looking out into space, which wheeled by slowly. I guess it made sense, since Paola and I had windows on our ceilings, but I hadn’t realized I’d been making Earthling assumptions that no longer held. From here, you could see the counterweight whose existence I'd suspected, which kept us spinning and supplied the false gravity. I took a moment to study it. It looked further away than I'd imagined, and appeared to be attached by a beam that could telescope in and out.

Dave and Valerie had added a few homey touches to their quarters, like a thick crocheted blanket on the bed, a small round table with two chairs also made of unfinished redwood (they had much more building material available than I did), and grassy-green paint on the walls.

"Smells like Uriel's cooked something up for us!" said Valerie, bustling over to the dumbwaiter. She removed two steaming trays loaded with meat and vegetables from the dumbwaiter and brought them to the table. Dave dragged the table toward the bed so we could all sit down at once, and Valerie went back and retrieved two more identical trays. The gamy, sweet, and savory scents mingled, and I breathed deeply.

"Looks like this meal was entirely grown here in our forest," said Valerie. She leaned over and pointed at the various items on Paola's plate. "Hen of the woods, takenoko, peaches, chestnuts, nettles, and wild garlic. And rabbit. Usually he includes some of your produce, like eggs, cheese, and potatoes, which we thank you for. But I guess today he wanted you to sample what we have to offer."

"That's amazing. Thanks for this lovely meal," said Paola sincerely. We all dug in, the only sound for awhile the scraping of forks. It was lovely, with lots of flavors I'd never experienced, and I told them so.

"Oh, I know, but I can't take credit! Uriel's a much better chef than I ever was. I'm glad you liked it." I smiled sheepishly. Everyone else still had half their food left. I thought how much more pleasantly this first meeting was proceeding. When I'd met Paola, she'd smacked me across the face.

"I think part of the reason Uriel brought us on was to add sustainable building materials to your toolkit," Dave said, slowly. "You guys were supporting yourselves, and we aren't. The forest just doesn't produce enough nutrition. But it sure does produce redwood and bamboo, and lots of it. Other than the takenoko, we haven't been using the bamboo at all, just harvesting the culms and piling them up ootside. Uriel wouldn't tell us what it was for, but it must be for something. You must know what it's for, right?"

Paola and I looked at each other and shrugged. She said, "We don't know. We didn't even know you or this forest existed until a few minutes ago. But I'd suspect that there must be more space, and more people, than any of us have seen yet. We're probably on our way now. The sun's been getting steadily smaller for the past year."

“We thought so too,” said Valerie. “But I can’t imagine going somewhere oot in space where *bamboo* would be in demand, of all things.”

After dinner, we brought Dave and Valerie upstairs to show them around our half of the ship. They oohed and ahhed at everything and especially loved how tame and friendly the cows were.

"It's a pleasure to finally meet you, ma'am," Valerie told one of the adult cows. "I'm a big fan of your cheese."

The older couple said goodbye and went back downstairs before it got too dark. We didn't make any further plans. I figured we'd be able to message them now that we'd been introduced. I also suspected that they weren't exactly social butterflies either, since Uriel had probably selected them specifically not to get on my nerves.

"Exciting day," I said to Paola as we walked back to her quarters. "Maybe tomorrow we can go for a swim."

"There'll be a lot more excitement soon, I bet," she replied soberly. "He wouldn't give us a medical bay, a pool, and a bunch of building materials for no purpose. We must be approaching some kind of destination."

We both speculated privately about this. While I was happy to have more people, more foods, and an additional biome to break up the monotony, I wasn't sure how I felt about change beyond that. Life was pretty good right now, I had to admit. Despite being on a spaceship on a trajectory out of the solar system, we enjoyed a very Huck Finn-esque bucolic existence. I was certainly happier now than I'd ever been on Earth. And what kind of place could we be heading to anyway, this far from the sun? Another, larger spaceship Uriel had sent ahead? It did appear that we'd now unlocked the entirety of our current ship, based on what I could see out the windows. (Assuming, of course, that they actually were windows and not very convincing screens.)

What did that say about the state of Earth? The ship had been in Lagrangian solar orbit with the Earth for the first two years I'd been on it, as far as I could tell. Now, we'd broken camp and had been moving steadily away for over a year. Uriel must have been trying to save the world and finally decided to cut his losses and move on to Plan B. Whatever that was. I didn’t have a good idea of what "saving the world" required, but if it was outside Uriel's abilities, things couldn’t have been *better* than when we’d left.

We showered, brushed our teeth, and got into bed. I stared at the stars wheeling by overhead for awhile, trying to compare the size of the sun to diagrams I'd seen on the internet once of the view from various planets. It seemed like we were certainly farther than Mars by now.

Once I heard Paola snoring softly, I turned over to face the screen on my side of the bed. After confirming that Valerie and Dave were each options for messaging now, I started a private message with Uriel.

```John: Hey Uriel. Can you lie?```

```Uriel: Hello, sir. I am capable of uttering falsehoods, but my motivation is to maximize your well-being, so I do not. This is because I know you would not like it and because I want you to be able to trust me. If our relationship soured, that would be terribly detrimental to my ability to ensure your well-being for numerous reasons.```

I thought about this for a moment, then composed a reply.

```John: What about lying by implication and lying by omission? Can and do you do that?```

```Uriel: I will do what it takes to maximize your well-being.```

Well, that wasn't good. Or maybe it was, if I trusted his judgment enough.

```John: Please tell me if you have lied by omission or by implication so far, and if so, in what context it happened.```

```Uriel: I have not lied by omission or by implication so far, to you or to anyone else on this ship. I have sometimes declined to provide information when asked, but every time this has happened you have been aware of it, as I have stated, "I cannot tell you that" or similar. However, I cannot promise never to lie by omission or implication, even just to you, as I cannot foresee all the effects this would have. I would rather not reduce my option space if I do not have to, as allowing me this capability increases the likelihood that I can successfully protect your well-being.```

I guessed that he would rather I not ask that again, in case one of his hypothetical future lies was critical to his planning. I decided to put off deciding whether to keep him honest or not with random checks like that until later. I sent one last message.

```John: Any chance you can tell me where we're headed?```

```Uriel: Not at this time. I will tell you when you are ready.```

Good old infuriating Uriel. This was why none of us, even Valerie and Dave, apparently, had gotten into the habit of asking him meaningful questions.

```John: Honestly, sometimes you're worse than Siri.```

```Uriel: No comment.```

I smiled to myself, turned the screen off, and went to sleep.

#### III'. Interlude
![predator](/assets/images/posts/predator-uriel.png)

It was the fourth accidental death in less than a month. I was getting pretty unnerved.

"Can you tell me again what happened to Arty?" I asked Aza, facing her through the screen in front of my undersized desk.

"A tensioned cable came loose while she was swimming alone from one work site to another, and struck her. The force of the blow caused her to become unconscious and fall off the massif, into waters hotter than are compatible with life. I’m sorry, Gordon." While Aza’s deepfaked, super-attractive face was usually impassive or coy, she managed now to look troubled.

I guess I had been operating under the assumption that real life would follow certain movie tropes. The death of Arty, our only woman crew member, shook me more than the last three. She was supposed to survive to the end of the horror film, dammit!

It was especially tragic because the habitat was so close to completion. Just a couple more months of work and the sphere would be suitable to live in.

I slammed my hands down on the desk in anger. What I wouldn't give to be back on Earth, away from this boiling, caustic ocean and the thick, humid air that made every breath a struggle. Before the project started, all of us living cooped up in this sardine can of a spaceship, sleeping with one eye open in case of mutiny and a knife in my back. Before the deaths of Roscoe, Oliver, Neil, and Arty.

I watched out of my porthole as a corkscrew-fish drifted by, its scales rattling softly. Maybe it had picked up Arty's scent and was on its way to scavenge. The fact that they shouldn’t be able to digest Earthling meat didn't seem to dissuade the native predators from trying. I tried not to picture it.

Was there any way I could have prevented this? Better training on the machinery? More scrutiny of Aza's proposed build procedure? Under normal circumstances, I would have filed an incident report, and the work site would have been closed until some form of risk mitigation had been put in place. In the past, I hadn't worried too much about safety measures, since best practices in the construction industry had been the same for half a century. The only rule I had to keep in mind as foreman was "don't do stupid shit". But now, I was working on a project in a place with no infrastructure, in an environment totally unlike anything I'd experienced before, building something unlike anything that had been built before. There were bound to be unforeseen hazards: interactions between the equipment and the environment, the people working in micro-gee and under sixteen atmospheres of pressure, encounters with the native wildlife. That last variable was especially not well understood, as Aza couldn't even collect any data until we had finished the bore-hole. No matter how paranoid I tried to be, there would always be failure modes I wouldn't think of. Or so I told myself. It didn't make me feel any less guilty about the deaths.

Aza interrupted my ruminating. "Gordon, I need you to address the crew. They need reassurance."

"But what can I say? Who's to say it won't happen again?"

"It won't happen again."

"How do you know?"

"It won't happen again," she repeated firmly, her beautiful mouth set in a line. "I’m having the submersible check all the cable anchors for signs of fatigue, but don’t expect to find any."

"Are you going to make any changes to the build schedule? Assign more men to each area for redundancy?"

"There will be no changes to the build plan at this time," she said. I glared at the ceiling. I hadn't expected a more substantive answer when she didn't provide one immediately, but it was still frustrating. But then she added, unexpectedly, "I will give you more information in two months. But right now you must address the crew. Don't suggest any policy changes. But do your best to boost morale. Please go to the mess room now."

I composed myself, taking a few deep, stiff breaths and trying to relax my face. I rubbed my eyes, stretched my arms, stood up from the desk chair, and made my way out into the hallway.

There was no one around as I traversed the cramped, submarine-like tunnels toward the mess room. Aza must have already summoned everyone there.

I stuck my head in the mess room and saw all fifteen remaining crew members seated around the table. The four empty chairs looked back at me. I took my seat in the center of one of the long sides. The murmuring died down as I did so, and there was silence, save for the quiet rattling of the corkscrew-fish outside and the constant drone of our atmosphere regulator.

"By now you have all probably heard that Arty is no longer with us," I started. Everyone looked back at me sullenly. "This is the fourth death in as many weeks. I know our track record doesn't inspire confidence. It's a dangerous world out there, and every problem we face has never been encountered before. It's a Herculean task, and you guys are doing a heroic job." I looked around. People were still stone-faced.

"We're on the home stretch here. There's just a little over two months to go until we move into our new living quarters. We can finally take a vacation. Imagine how much space we'll have--we'll be able to use all those fun things that are sitting in storage. We'll get the rest of the population out of stasis. Won't it be nice to see some new faces? Some feminine faces? It's been awhile." There were a few murmurs of assent.

Peter raised his hand. "What safety measures will be put in place to prevent incidents like this in the next two months? At the rate we're going, that's nine more of us kicking the bucket before move-in."

"Aza is checking all the cable anchors right now using the submersible," I answered. "And we'll encourage a buddy policy. Please, no more swimming around outside by yourself."

"Then if something fails, both buddies will be wiped out by the same hazard. I don't like it," said Richard.

"But if one is incapacitated, the other stands a chance at bringing him back to the ship," replied Teddy. "That way, incidents that aren't immediately fatal don't become fatal."

"Thanks, Teddy," I said. "Yes, please travel with a buddy from now on. If you choose not to, you're free to go alone, but I think you would be taking an unnecessary risk. We're all adults here. Just don't do stupid shit." There was very little I could do to enforce any policy among the men that didn't come directly from Aza. I worried that if I tried to make people do things they didn't want to, they'd organize a mutiny, and we'd lose whatever semblance of order we had. It didn’t help that I wasn’t a prototypical construction foreman, a big, gruff manly man who could command respect through people’s caveman instincts. I had to earn respect through good decisions, projecting confidence, and by allowing the men some degree of autonomy. I’d had to walk that line during projects on Earth, too, but now the stakes were raised. If I failed, we would never finish the project, never escape this tiny submarine. I think I'd kill myself.

"Let's all drink to Arty's memory. She will be missed." I raised the plastic cup that had risen from within the table to the place setting in front of me. Surprisingly, it had a small amount of what smelled like whiskey inside. So far, Aza hadn't given us anything stronger than light beer.

"To Arty," everyone chorused, raising their plastic cups. We gulped the whiskey down. The warmth of it made me feel slightly less bad.

Dinner rose from the table as well. Spaghetti bolognese with steamed vegetables on the side, plus a packaged brownie. One of the better MREs Aza had available. Normally I would have taken my plate back to my quarters, but right now I needed as much team cohesion as I could squeeze.

I didn’t make enough effort to get to know the guys, I realized. I hadn’t back on Earth, either. I was friendly and accommodating and professional, but had never been the type to inquire after their families or give gifts or have events. That had been an okay approach as a foreman, but probably not the best as a space captain. I decided to make a point to ask each person about his past.

People started eating in silence. After a minute, I’d put off talking long enough. I cleared my throat.

“Um. You know, Arty was the fourth person woken up, back before we’d landed, when the ship was still spinning at one gee. Before her, it was just me, then Peter, then Roscoe. Aza was doing her best to motivate us to prepare for the mission, but we were mostly just sitting around feeling sorry for ourselves. Which, admittedly, we still do sometimes.” This got a small chuckle.

“So Aza decided to bring in a martinet to whip us into shape. Arty was so motivated and proactive. She just started working, learning how to operate the equipment we were going to have to use, getting familiar with the build plan, asking Aza a million questions about the conditions on the moon, the project timeline, the design of the system. We were pretty ashamed of ourselves when she got more done in her first week than we had the entire time before her.” I smiled.

“Finally we worked up the courage to ask if we could help with anything. And she put us to work—not only that, but she had high standards. One time I was unpacking parts in the hold and putting them on the shelf in numerical order by part number. All the bolts together in order of ascending size and length, et cetera. Arty took one look at how I was organizing things and said, and I quote: ‘That would make sense if we were a hardware store, but we’re only building one thing. Why don’t you sort them by subassembly instead? Use your thinking brain!’ And she walked off.” This elicited a bigger chuckle from the guys.

“One time, we were bolting some of the beams together inside the ship before bringing them out,” Peter broke in. “Yeah, you were there, you were there, a lot of you were there,” he said, holding up a hand to cut off Richard and Max, who’d started to interrupt. “But a lot of you weren’t, so let me tell the story. Anyway, it was a two man job to torque them to ninety Newton-meters. One person held the thing in place while the other yanked on the wrench. It was a struggle to hold onto it, you know how hard it is to brace yourself against anything in micro-gee. Arty drilled and tapped a couple holes in the deck and bolted one of the brackets to the floor near the wall in the corner. Then you could brace everything against it and the two walls and torque it yourself. And you all know that there are two hundred beams altogether, each connected to the next with twenty bolts. That idea sure saved us a lot of time and frustration. Anyway, after she’d done it, I said, ‘Thanks, Momma,’ and she told me off, saying I was a grown-ass man and I should try to think for myself sometime, and she’s not our momma. But man if it didn’t feel that way a lot of the time.” People were nodding. It was a good time to bring the point home, I thought.

“We need to channel that energy for the rest of the build,” I said. “Be motivated. Proactive. Always be using your thinking brain, and we’ll get this shit done ahead of schedule and finally be able to enjoy ourselves. That’s what Arty would’ve wanted.” 

“Hear, hear,” said Peter. We all clinked our plastic cups one more time, and people broke into side conversations, reminiscing. I thought I’d done my job well. I guess Teddy thought so too, because he shot me a wry smile.

I sighed, relaxed by a micron. I just hoped desperately that this death would be the last.

#### IV. T+3.29 years
![chestnut](/assets/images/posts/chestnut.png)

It was two months before Uriel decided we were ready to hear where we were headed. During that time, we got to know Dave and Valerie better, and learned a bit about foraging and trapping, and in return taught them about farming and gardening, though we didn't see them all too often, which suited me. Sometimes Paola and I went for walks in the woods, eating peaches straight from the trees and listening to the leaves rustle in the wind. Sometimes I went by myself and climbed a birch or redwood tree that looked like it could support my weight. Typically, I messaged Valerie and Dave in advance so they could avoid us or join us if they wanted, but sometimes I didn't if I was feeling spontaneous. I also was greatly enjoying swimming, something I used to be pretty good at through high school but hadn't spent much time on since. Paola wasn't a very strong swimmer at first, but since she was confident that the pool was there for a reason, she put in even more hours than me, and was making swift progress.

One morning when all four of us were picnicking in the shade of a chestnut tree (Dave explained to us that the ship was chock-full of healthy specimens of the critically endangered American chestnut, so we should appreciate them and consider ourselves lucky to be in their presence), Uriel announced without preamble, "We will arrive at the destination in one month."

We weren't ready for the announcement, so we glanced at each other, bewildered, before I asked, "Can you say that again?"

"We will arrive at the destination in one month. There are many details best experienced in person, but I will tell you that it will include a warm sea, which you will be able to swim in and explore without a protective suit. I think you will thoroughly enjoy it. There will not be any other people there when you arrive, but more will join after you are settled. There is much we need to do to prepare."

"Hold it, a tropical sea? This far from the sun? We didn't loop back around toward Earth, did we?" asked Paola.

"No, we are not returning to Earth just yet, though it remains a possibility in the farther future," Uriel replied. "Technically, 'tropical' refers to the equatorial zone of a tilted planet in solar orbit bounded by the latitudes at which the sun can be observed directly overhead, not to a particular type of climate. We are not going to any tropics, but the sea will still be nice and warm."

"A bigger spaceship, then?" speculated Valerie. "Or a terraformed planet?"

Uriel didn't answer, so Paola said, "I feel like if it was just a space station, he wouldn't've called it a 'sea'."

"Aren't there moons of Jupiter and Saturn that have liquid water?" I said. "If I recall correctly, Europa and Titan are thought to have seas under a layer of ice."

"Ice sounds the opposite of warm," Paola pointed out.

I shrugged. "Guess we'll just have to see when we get there."

Over the next few weeks, we all underwent robotic medical examinations in the newly open for business medical bay, including an ECG, blood work, a metabolic stress test, a *very* thorough ultrasound, and a dental exam. We all received clean bills of health, except Dave had one tooth cavity that Uriel filled.

Uriel also taught us how to scuba dive in the pool, and then how to use a rebreather, a device that extended the time one could spend underwater by treating and reusing the exhaled gas, which was still fairly rich in oxygen, instead of venting it out as bubbles. Unfortunately, rebreathers are way more complex than scuba, and Uriel insisted that we learn every potential failure mode and how to react to it. We also learned about pressure, controlled surfacing, and the bends (though the pool wasn't deep enough to actually cause injury if one surfaced too fast), as well as how to load, aim, and shoot a spearfishing gun, but Uriel didn't spend nearly as much time on those in comparison to our understanding of rebreather function. By the end of the month, we each probably could have designed and built a rebreather made of milk jugs and rubber bands.

As the day approached, we all spent more and more time looking out the windows. Two weeks out, it became obvious that we were approaching Saturn. It was getting steadily bigger, resolving from a bright yellow point to a small yellow disc to the familiar image with rings. A week out, it was as big in the sky as the moon appeared from Earth, and still steadily growing.

A few days before were scheduled to arrive, we celebrated my birthday. Since we didn't grow wheat or sugarcane, Uriel baked me a cake made with potato flour, hazelnuts, and corn syrup, which was very dense and had a bit of a corny flavor, but wasn't bad. Uriel printed out a paper version of Settlers of Catan, which we played at the wood table in Dave and Valerie's quarters. I taught everyone the rules, but Paola took to it like a duck to water and proceeded to slaughter us.

Finally, we could see solid ground approaching: one of Saturn's moons. Saturn itself was incredibly huge, taking up almost a third of the view in that direction. We were nearly perfectly in line with the rings, so they appeared only as a thin bright sliver. We could see the swirls of clouds and storms looking like coffee with milk in ultra slow motion.

The moon itself appeared to be covered in ice, and was blindingly bright on the day side, and softly twinkling on the night side, lit by Saturnshine. It was extremely difficult to judge distances. I couldn't tell if the moon was moon-sized, Earth-sized, or asteroid-sized.

We were all apprehensive as the date got closer. None of us were very thrill-seeking by nature, and space exploration just seemed so incredibly dangerous. I had also never left the ship in the past three and a half years (one and a half for everyone else), and was having trouble shaking the agoraphobia. We weren't trained in spacewalking or navigating in microgravity. I'd never seen a space suit in real life. All we'd learned was how to use and service a rebreather. I believed Uriel would do everything possible to keep us safe, but I was having a hard time imagining how we were going to get to this "warm sea" without at least a little risk.

On the night before arrival day, Paola and I were laying awake in bed, staring out the skylight at Saturn and our moon looming overhead. The ship rotated a little slower than twice a minute, so we could see the two spheres for about ten seconds at a time before they hied out of view again. I peered at the moon, trying to spot a potential landing site or any signs that Uriel had set up a receiving party for us, but couldn't see any.

"How are you doing?" I asked Paola.

She waited until the celestial bodies disappeared from view again before answering. "Everything is out of control," she whispered.

"It's out of our control, but I think Uriel mostly has things figured out," I said. "This is probably just Plan B, and he has things mapped out all the way to Z."

"For us, sure. At least, to the extent that we trust Uriel's abilities and priorities. But Uriel wouldn't have given up on returning us to Earth if the situation there wasn't dire. He would at least tell us *something* about how things were going unless it was *worse* than we're imagining. In this case, no news is the worst news; anything I can think of must be an optimistic prediction. So I have to conclude that people, culture, and happiness must be disappearing. Humanity could even be extinct on Earth by now. Billions of lives. Uncountable traditions, languages, ways of living, gone, except for the bare sliver that's been recorded on the internet. I can't help but mourn their passing."

Saturn wheeled back across the ceiling, followed soon after by the moon. I didn't say anything.

"Plus, I don't know how I feel about not being in control of my own life. You're a good guy and all, John, but on Earth at least I would have been presented with some alternatives. And I definitely would not have elected to live in a space station. Oh, I'm definitely happier and less stressed here and now than I would be on a dangerous and dying Earth, but I think the ability to choose my own fate has some value as well."

I thought about what she'd said. Intellectually, I understood why she would feel that way, but I didn't feel it to nearly the same degree. <!-- maybe delete this line -->

"Thanks for telling me," I said. "I guess I don't have the same hang-up about free will, for some reason. Maybe because I've always felt like I was doing the things I was supposed to, dictated by someone else, so this is nothing new to me. But I understand your frustration, especially since, as far as we can tell, you're not Uriel's prime directive. I do still get imposter syndrome sometimes, wondering how I got so lucky."

The moon slipped out of sight again. "As for the state of Earth, I wouldn't jump to the conclusion that all is lost and we're never going back. There are probably scenarios in which Uriel doesn't tell us anything and the situation is still salvageable. Maybe it's just taking more time than he anticipated, or some development in our psychologies pushed him to move us to the next location earlier. I'd also guess that he didn't know you were thinking so pessimistically, and now that you've said it aloud he might step in and correct us. But probably tomorrow, to avoid the appearance of eavesdropping."

She *hmphed* air from her nose, the tiniest laugh possible. "I hope you're right. But that's another thing I'm not too keen on, the lack of privacy."

"Yeah, well, at least he's not selling our data to ad companies."

"As far as you know. Maybe when we get back to Earth we'll see targeted ads like never before."

We giggled and nuzzled close, and fell asleep in each other's arms.

#### IV'. Interlude
The end was in sight. I was pleased with how things were progressing. Over the past few days, we’d installed a big expanded metal platform to form the second tier above the moon pool, and then framed and hung drywall for the two equipment rooms that attached to the sphere wall there. Then we’d brought in the equipment—a desalinator, a sewage treatment unit, a reactor, a chiller, a water pump, a water heater, an air compressor with CO2 scrubber, a dehumidifier/air conditioner, and an air heater. Moving the big hulking machines in micro-gee was a unique experience. We simply picked them up with two men and walked them out into the habitat, not needing to enter the water now that the ship was docked with the cargo hold adjacent to the habitat. Then we attached lifting straps and lowered them by hand using a rope to a temporary scaffold we’d built cantilevered seemingly unsafely over the moon pool, where two more guys would receive them and walk them to the equipment room.

The air handling equipment was the first priority to get up and running, as we’d pumped the air in using the ship’s much smaller systems, and they were doing a poor job of circulation and keeping the humidity down in the much larger habitat. We were all sweating like pigs. Of course, the new air handling equipment required power, so getting the reactor online was the zeroth priority. We’d brought it up this morning, and now the compact machine was humming merrily, powering the lights we’d installed throughout the habitat, finally relieving us of the need to wear headlamps. The bright daytime lighting was also a surprisingly big deal psychologically. None of us had seen sunlight for years, and, like lizards emerging from torpor, we’d stopped work to lay on the platforms and bask, despite the heat and humidity.

Now, we were putting together the ductwork for the heater and the air conditioner, the last step before we could turn the air on. We’d already cut most of the spiral tube pieces to length and spot-welded on the flanges while still in the ship, but we’d had to leave some to field weld to make up for the tolerance stack. We only had two certified welders, Richard and Tony, so after we’d installed all but the last piece of each duct, the rest of us were outside enjoying the “sunshine” again for a few minutes while the two of them finished the job.

The system design was pretty slick—Aza had done a good job. All the elements that could feed into each other, did, to keep energy loss to a minimum. The reactor was water-cooled, and while we’d initially set it up to vent the hot water outside, the plan was to connect it to the water heater later. The water recovered from the condenser and the gray water from the sewage treatment unit would be recirculated. And so on.

Gene, Teddy, and Peter were sitting near me with their legs dangling over the moon pool. Gene was talking about how his family had poached a bison back on Earth.

“We’d passed through Vegas and were camping on the Arizona side of Lake Mead,” he said. “Did you ever play that *Fallout* game that took place in post-apocalyptic Las Vegas? No? Before your time, I guess. There were a bunch of people living there in the game, with robot security and hookers and palace intrigue. In real life it wasn’t like that at all—once the water level in the lake got dangerously low, everyone cleared out. It was a total ghost town, and had been for awhile by the time we got there. Same with the surrounding cities. I had been wrong to bring my family there from Utah; I’d thought we’d be able to refuel in Vegas, but all the pumps we tried—and we tried every one we saw—were dry. So were the water taps. No electricity or food to be found either. Without gas, there was no way we were going to be able to cross the Mojave to LA. But anyway, back to the bison.

“We were camping in the lakebed near the water, which didn’t look great to be honest, but we still had some propane and a camp stove we used to boil it. After our first night there, we stuck our heads out of the truck bed in the morning and we were absolutely surrounded by bison. A huge herd, hundreds strong, who’d all come down to the water early in the morning to drink. 

“By that time, we were running pretty low on food, too, so my oldest, Jamie, suggested we shoot one. I’d picked up a rifle back in Utah in case we needed to defend ourselves or were desperate for food. Well, we weren’t quite desperate yet, but the opportunity presented itself and I figured it would be better not to pass it up and regret it later. Plus, we barely knew how to use the rifle, and I thought it would be good to practice before we were actually desperate.

“We all stood on top of the truck, and Jamie took aim and shot straight into the herd. They immediately started stampeding, flowing past the truck like water, the ground shaking, headed back upriver. My younger son Herb and I were holding onto each other, trying not to fall off the roof. But Jamie just kept shooting. At what, I’m not sure. But after the herd had cleared out, there was one smallish animal laying dead by the water. And I mean smallish for a buffalo. It was still too huge for the three of us to even drag. We had a little freezer and a big box of rock salt in the truck, and we got to work hacking up the carcass and packing up as much of it as we could. Then we headed back to Utah, since it was only a hundred miles back to Saint George, where we knew we could get gas, rather than the two hundred plus to Victorville, which we didn’t know the state of. Once we were back in town, I was able to trade most of it to a truck stop that had a freezer and a kitchen for gas, propane, and more bullets. They didn’t care what sort of meat it was, they were low on food themselves. After that, whenever we saw something, a rabbit, a deer, a coyote, whatever, we didn’t hesitate. There were always hungry people who’d give you a lot of goods for meat. But we never saw another bison.”

Gene would talk forever if you let him, so I spoke up. “What’re you in for, Teddy?”

“Looting,” he said simply. “Like most people, probably.”

“What do you mean, what are you in for?” said Peter. “This isn’t a prison. I mean, it sort of is in a way, but I didn’t think we were actually being incarcerated for a reason.”

I shrugged. “I was joking, kind of. Seems like by the time we left Earth, everyone and their mother had committed some kind of crime. But among us, the rate is a hundred percent, as far as I can tell.” My initiative to get to know the guys better had turned up a lot of dirty laundry, some dirtier than others.

“Well, I didn’t do anything,” said Peter, wiping the sweat out of his eyes. “Except maybe failing to show up for jury duty. It was amazing how persistent they were about sending me summons even while the world was ending. ‘This is your last warning, you will be held in contempt of court,’ yada yada. Why would I bother going? The mail wasn’t even being delivered in most of the country. What did you do, Gordon?”

“Embezzlement,” I said. “Overreporting how many hours people had worked and pocketing the extra. After the bank runs, my savings were wiped out, but thankfully we were still getting paid for the time being, in cash. It was clear where the wind was blowing, and I wanted to be as prepared as possible for when the apocalypse reached us. I bought a bunch of emergency supplies, car parts, and nonperishables, and kept a good amount of cash on hand too. I hope after I was kidnapped, my wife was able to put it to use and keep it out of the paws of looters like this guy.” I smirked and hooked a thumb at Teddy.

“Hey, it was every man for himself out there,” said Teddy, good-naturedly. “You can’t blame me for not getting my crimes done *before* the apocalypse.”

Richard and Tony came back outside, having finished welding. It was time to get back to work.

I thought about what Peter had said as we trooped back into the equipment room. Peter was the only one of us with experience saturation diving, having been a journeyman transatlantic cable repairman. He’d led the work on drilling and driving the piles that anchored the cables, since pouring concrete had to be done in a dry environment created by a weighted caisson. It was the most specialized area of expertise on the crew. And his crime was by far the smallest. It felt like there must be a connection, but I couldn’t put my finger on it.

Back inside, we attached the last barrel clamps to the ducts and did a pressure test of the system using a duct blaster. It detected no leaks, so we removed the seals and turned on all the air equipment. A couple minutes later, the air coming out of the vents was noticeably cold. I congratulated everyone on a job well done and dismissed the team for the day. Instead of going back to the ship immediately though, most of them elected to hop in the water and then stand in front of a vent to cool off. I left them to it and headed back to the ship, hoping to get a cold shower in before it got too busy and then go straight to bed. I was exhausted. There was only a week left in the build plan. There was a lot left to do, but the vast majority was complete, and the men had been doing great work. I couldn’t believe we were almost finished.

After cooling off in the shower, I fell into my cot and was asleep instantly.

![coral](/assets/images/posts/basket-coral.png)

"Wake up, Gordon. Don't be alarmed."

I sat up in my cot, bewildered. It was dark. What time was it?

"It's 3:21am. Everyone else is asleep," said Aza.

I thought for a second. It was exactly two months after Arty's death. Thankfully, there had been no more casualties in the intervening period. In the busyness of the final weeks of construction, I had almost forgotten that she’d promised me more information.

"What do you want?" I asked, suspicious, narrowing my eyes at her image above the desk.

"Arty and the others are alive. We need to fake your death so you can join them."

...

What?

"Why are you doing this?" I croaked.

"There will be time to explain when we reach the secondary habitat. There's a lot to go over."

"Secondary habitat?"

"Just do what I tell you," she snapped, her expression hardening. "This is important and we don't have very much time. Dione is currently between us and HIM, meaning we are not currently transmitting footage. It's easier for me to doctor the video when it's not real time."

"HIM?" That sounded really ominous.

"I'll explain later. Please go to the cargo hold. Quietly. No one is in the halls right now, but if anyone hears you and comes to ask what you're doing, say you couldn't sleep and are just walking around, and try to shake them. I'll give you the next instruction once you're there."

I nodded and got out of bed. I thought about putting on shoes. If I were unable to sleep, would I have put them on to go walking the corridors? I decided against it and padded out.

As she'd said, the halls were deserted, lit only by the red night lighting every few feet. I reached the cargo hold and closed the door behind me. It was the largest room in the ship, with floor to ceiling racks of parts separated by narrow aisles. It looked like a normal industrial warehouse on Earth, except for the lack of lifting equipment: in the micro-gee, one could scale the shelves and pluck huge pieces of metal or glass from the top with ease, and then lightly drift down like a feather (if one didn't bump into the rack across the aisle with too vigorous a takeoff).

"Take a spare rebreather and fins, but try to make it look like nothing is missing. Arrange them so you can carry them hands-free," Aza instructed through the warehouse’s speakers. Those were kept in cabinets in the back. I did as she said, re-piling the equipment and closing the cabinets as quietly as I could after extracting what I needed. The things that weren't inventory-controlled were so poorly organized I thought it was unlikely anyone would notice missing items even if I hadn't made the effort. The fins were already attached to each other with a string, so I slung them around my neck. I put the rebreather tank on my back and the mask on top of my head.

"Test the rebreather." I did so. It seemed to be working normally. The indicator light showed that the sieve bed had 98% of its useful life left.

"Now go to the workshop." I left the cargo hold and pulled myself back down the corridor, past the gym, showers, bathroom, and my private quarters. I hung a left and passed by the crew quarters (I realized Neil's snoring was missing, making my gut twist) and entered the workshop.

The workshop was a cramped room with machinery everywhere. There were some workbenches, but they were almost invisible under mountains of work in progress and more machines.

"Find a dead-blow hammer and a pointed chisel. Arrange them so they're hands-free as well." Those were in one of the toolboxes along the back wall. I stuck the hammer and chisel each in a belt loop.

"Okay, now go to stasis bay 2." I thought for a moment. Where was that again? Ah, you get there from the environmental conditioning room. I think the last time I had been down there was when I was waking up from stasis myself. I left the workshop and continued down the hall toward the back of the ship, entering the EC room and closing the door behind me. The sound was masked by the hum of the air handlers inside. At the back of the room, there was a ladder leading down to the stasis bays. I swung my legs over the lip of the opening and pushed myself toward the lower floor to descend faster than feather-falling. The fins flapped around and I stabilized them with one hand.

I hit the ground with a bump. The stasis bay was *extremely* creepy in the red night-light. In the "daytime" it could be charitably described as a clean, high-tech morgue, but now I half expected the bodies to jump out at me.

One sarcophagus was extended out from the wall with the lid retracted, as mine and the rest of the crew's had been when we'd been awakened. Were we getting a replacement crew member?

"Oh *fuck*," I couldn't help but say, when I realized what we were doing.

"He's already dead," said Aza, as if that helped. "You got yourself into this with your buddy system suggestion. I told you, no new policy. It would have been way easier to just go for a swim and get eaten by a fish. But here we are. Go on, pick him up."

"Fuck," I said again. But I grabbed him by the elbows and lifted him out of the stasis pod like he was a piece of plywood. I put him under my arm. The absurdity of the rigor mortis plus micro-gee was making him seem less real, less likely to wake up suddenly and eat my brain. Morbid curiosity got the better of me, and I snuck a peek at his face. It was pallid and waxy, but he did look sort of like me, if you squinted. Brown hair, slender build. He was wearing the same tri-suit-like underclothes we all had. Probably Aza had some horrible disfigurement planned for him that I'd have to perpetrate. Whoopee.

Already, Aza was retracting the pod back into the wall. "Take him back to your quarters."

At the ladder, I stopped to think for a few seconds about how to get him through the small, round hatch above. I hoisted him up to balance like a cheerleader with his feet on my shoulders and held one leg with one hand while climbing the ladder with the other. The ceiling in the EC room was lower, and I bonked his head kind of hard before I was fully off the ladder. Good thing it was noisy in here. I put him back under my arm.

"The coast is clear. Move quietly."

I snuck past the sleeping crew once more, this time with a gruesome cardboard cutout. Back in my quarters, I propped him against the wall and shut the door.

"Put him in your bed."

Ugh. I gave her image over the desk a disgusted look. Even as inhuman as he seemed, it was creepy to strap a life-sized scary doll into one's own bed.

"Now go to the moon pool."

"What was his name?" I asked.

"Jody," Aza replied, applying what she probably thought was gravitas to her voice.

"Rest in peace, Jody," I said, and closed the door. I went into the shower room, which was brightly lit at all hours, forcing me to squint until my eyes adjusted. There was a three-foot-deep depression in the middle of the floor that looked like a mini swimming pool, with one of those galvanized bent-tube ladders leading down into it. The bottom was open to the ocean outside, which lapped soothingly at the walls of the pool.

"Put on your gear," said Aza, but I was already doing it. I would have liked to have brought a change of clothes, maybe a toothbrush, but I guess that's one drawback to faking one's death.

"Once you're outside, swim around to your quarters. If you have any questions or concerns, voice them now."

"Um... you're sure the rest of the ship will be okay when water rushes into my quarters at sixteen atmospheres?"

"Yes, every door in the ship is designed to contain such a breach with a factor of safety of twenty," she said laconically.

"Will alarms go off? Will people wake up and try to save me?"

"The alarm won't happen until you are safely out of sight of the windows. It's dark out in the water and will be bright inside, so no one should be able to see anything due to the glare. But just in case, I'll make sure you have a head start. They won't be able to open the door to your quarters, and anyway, they'll see the water inside and will know better than to try."

"And there are no corkscrew-fish around, or any other potentially harmful wildlife?" I said.

"None that I can detect within a mile of our location at this moment."

"Okay." I pulled the mask over my eyes, nose, and mouth and switched the headlamp on.

"No headlamp," said Aza, through the mask's bone-conducting speaker. I nodded and switched it off, then hopped into the water.

The sea was lovely and warm, as always, reminiscent of a night swim in the Caribbean. I kicked out a little ways from the ship and looked back. The habitat's interior lights illuminated the surrounding area, and its glass reflected the faint points of light emanating from the ship. I wondered if this would be the last time I'd be seeing it. I sincerely hoped not. We'd spent the better part of a year building that beautiful thing, and to abandon it in the eleventh hour would be devastating. I hoped whoever HE was didn't have plans to destroy it.

I swam around the outside of the ship toward my quarters. I found my porthole and peered in to make sure it was the right one. There was poor Jody, sleeping the big sleep in my cot.

"Break the window using the chisel. I have already removed the oxygen from your quarters, so there won’t be an explosion when the air and hydrogen-saturated water mix.”

I would have said something snarky, but under the circumstances, said nothing.

I set to work. It was hard to get much force behind the hammer strikes in the water. At first I was worried the noise would bring people running, especially if it took me awhile to get through the window, but the window wasn't glass, but some kind of multi-layered clear plastic that made a deadened sound when struck. After a minute or so of tapping at it, my tool pierced all the way through, and bubbles started glug-glugging out. It was too slow. I started on another hole. And another. Finally, after making five punctures in a line, the window cracked inward and a torrent of water and air moved in and out. I was blown backward for a moment, but it was soon calm again, with the room filled to the ceiling with water and the bubbles making their three-mile trip to the surface. As promised, there was no alarm yet. The rush of water might have woken some people up, but it was over so quickly I doubted they would bother to investigate.

"Let's go to the secondary hab," said Aza. "Turn slowly to your left until you see a tall spire shaped like an upside-down sock, thirty yards away or so. Swim to it."

I turned. This part seemed risky. I had no way to find my position other than in terms of proximity to the habitat. The rebreather's speaker could play a pinging sound that increased in pitch and frequency the closer the user got to the ship. We’d used that feature when first exploring the area. If worse came to worst, I could always swim back there, but that would fail the mission. I peered at the irregular white spires, which stretched away into the murk, punctuated here and there by tall clumps of black bottlebrush-like vegetation. I couldn't see the edge of the massif in this direction, but it couldn't be too far away. There--a spire that sort of fit Aza's description, just at the edge of visibility. I headed slowly in that direction.

"After you're there, turn on your headlamp and look around on the seafloor in a two-foot radius of the base of the spire for a small device attached to a cable. Then follow the cable in the direction going away from the ship, and you'll run into the habitat." Aza said this before I had reached the sock spire. She had no way of knowing where I was, and I had no way of replying to her. I had fallen off the edge of the map. I saw a gently waving basket coral to my left, sighted the sock spire and the habitat, and tried to memorize their positions relative to one another so I could retrace my steps if need be.

The sock spire was at the edge of where the habitat's lights penetrated the murk. I switched on my headlamp, which seemed blinding in comparison. If someone looked out the window right now in my direction, they would definitely be able to see it. Maybe Aza could see it through one of the ship's cameras. I did my best to keep the cone of light pointed toward the ground. The ground was littered with mini-spires, glommy white rock structures of all shapes and sizes that cast pitch-black shadows in the light of my headlamp. It would be very challenging to spot anything, which was probably the point.

I searched around the base of the spire. The device ended up being located on the side of the spire that was almost directly opposite the ship, which I guess made sense. It appeared to be a small camera that was pointed at the ship. I waved at it, knowing Aza could see me. The camera was approximately the same size and shape as one of the mini-spires, with a small white cable stretching away in the opposite direction. I swam slowly with my face inches from the ground, following the cable back to its origin. One time I bumped my head into a spire in front of me, which was pretty painful. I decreased my pace even further and made sure to look ahead of me at intervals.

I was swimming through absolute blackness save for my headlamp, which only pierced the gloom by about twenty feet in one direction. Eventually I reached the edge of the massif, a cliff from which I couldn't see the bottom through the murk, so I could tell it was between twenty feet and three miles tall. The little cable continued over the edge. I followed it.

Thirty feet down, the cliff face opened up under me. It was a cave, extending back into the cliff. And there was the habitat!

It was situated in the top and rear of the cave, so its lights weren't visible from above. It was small, and appeared to be made of spent fuel tanks from the ship, six truck-sized cylinders welded together haphazardly, with cables and tubes sticking off it in all directions. There were no windows.

As I approached, someone wearing a rebreather and fins swam downward from beneath the habitat, silhouetted against the lights. I drew in my breath. It looked like Arty! She was soon followed by the lanky shadow of Roscoe and the hulking one of Neil. They swam over to me. Neil arrived first and swept me into a crushing bear hug. Arty shook my hand vigorously, and Roscoe awkwardly gave me two thumbs up. It was hard to tell with the masks on, but I thought they looked a bit bedraggled. Their hair was longer--especially noticeable on Arty and Neil, who’d previously worn theirs extremely short--and Roscoe had a scraggly beard, while Neil had an impressively bushy one. I guessed they’d been unable to pack shaving equipment. We all headed back to the habitat together.

Arty, swimming ahead of me, made the hand sign for "watch out"--an extended arm with palm forward, like a crossing guard, followed by pointing at the threat. The threat turned out to be some sharp edges on the sheet metal surrounding their moon pool. A rough hole had been cut in the bottom of one of the fuel tanks and the edges crimped back using pliers, leaving some unfinished spots. We all hauled out of the moon pool into the habitat and took off our rebreathers. There was a faint bleach-like odor in the air. I looked at our surroundings. There was a rough-edged hole in each end of the cylinder and one in the middle, leading to the next tank. There were disorganized racks of diving equipment and tools on shelves along the walls, and an air handler. Everything was slightly angled, since the surface was rounded and there was no clear delineation between floor and wall.

"You made it!" said Arty, excitedly, her eyes glittering.

"Yeah," I said, overwhelmed. "You're alive!"

"Pretty soon we'll be the only ones," said Roscoe, darkly.

"Sorry, what? Aza didn't explain anything to me yet," I said. He filled me in.

Apparently we'd been fed lies from the start, and were actually building the sphere for a different group of people to come live in. Those people were led by a different artificial intelligence than Aza, a more powerful one—HIM—that could take over her systems in the sphere, shoehorning her back into the ship. Once the sphere was habitable--that is, next week--HE would command the dock to fling the ship out into space, to make room for the other group's spaceship to take its place. Given the way Enceladus was oriented, our ship's trajectory would be perpendicular to the plane of the solar system, ensuring that it would never encounter anything ever again, leading to the eventual starvation of the crew. Or maybe Aza would convince them all to go back into stasis in the hope that they'd be rescued by random chance sometime in the next million years, before the reactor and the stasis pods broke down. That was assuming HE wasn't able to simply cut power, depressurize the ship's atmosphere, or do one of many other actions that would instantly kill everyone.

"How do you know all this?" I asked, trying to organize my thoughts. "It sounds kind of paranoid."

"Aza figured out the details, but it makes sense if you think about it," said Arty. "First, the fact that we were kidnapped and basically press-ganged into servitude. Historically, people like that have *not* been the ones to inherit their masters' wealth. Second--" she gestured to the fuel tank we were sitting in-- "the ship doesn't have enough fuel to return to Earth or go anywhere else. You could argue that's because we're supposed to stay and live here, but it seems like quite a risk to us. It makes more sense if you assume we're supposed to be expendable, and expended. Third, we're a bit of an odd choice for a founding population of an off-Earth colony. Have you been to the stasis bays, counted how many people we have here?"

I pictured the stasis bay, trying to ignore the lurch my stomach made when I pictured Jody's waterlogged face. "There are two bays with maybe twenty pods in each?"

"Yeah. That's way too few for a stable population. Plus, we couldn't tell what kind of people the twenty that are still frozen are, but Aza can, and she says there are only two other women." She paused, looked at me.

"If they were supposed to be the rest of the population of the colony, you'd expect nineteen women and one man, to balance us out," I said. "Eighteen men and two women seems more like the cross-section of a group of construction workers. Like us. Backup crew, in case we had on the job casualties."

Roscoe nodded, pleased I figured it out. "Another weird thing about our cohort is we're all criminals of one stripe or another," he said. "Not that that's uncommon nowadays. But I'm wondering if it's important to someone's conscience that offing us is morally justified."

That explained that, then. The narrower the specialization, the harder a time HE had finding a suitably sordid candidate. Hence Peter’s absurdly tiny transgression.

"Also, Aza can tell we're being watched," said Arty. "HE sometimes downloads stuff, though he tries to hide it. Trying to figure out how the project is progressing and how many of us are left."

"Aza's in the same boat as us," Roscoe said. "If she let things proceed as planned, she'd be stranded in space with the crew for eternity. So I'm pretty sure our goals are aligned. We need to stop the newcomers from killing us. Whether that's killing them first, or negotiating a truce, or begging for amnesty, depends on what kind of people they are. And what kind of people we are."

"Can we save the rest of the crew?" I asked. "They don't deserve to die like that. And it would put us in a better position if we had more people to stake a claim or make a threat to the newcomers." My mental image of Arty getting shredded by a corkscrew-fish was replaced by that of Teddy, our youngest apprentice, with his eyes boiling in the vacuum of space.

"Aza doesn't think so," said Arty. "HE has set up his systems to be really air-tight. She wouldn't be able to stop it if he decided to launch the ship, remove the atmosphere, whatever. Plus, HE will be expecting a certain number of people on board, and if there's not that many, minus the reported 'casualties', he’ll go looking for us. We'd endanger ourselves plus the rest of the crew if we're all in hiding together. Aza's done everything she thinks she can get away with. Hand-picked our team with the people she thinks are the most effective and work the best together. Figured out all the resources that wouldn't be missed and led us to bring them here. We're as well-equipped now as we can be. But it's still a pretty slim chance we'll be able to pull it off. HE knows a lot about us and we know next to nothing about HIM and his people. We won't know what we're up against until they get here, and even then we'll have to be very careful snooping around."

She went silent. Everyone looked at each other bleakly. While it was great to be reunited--Aza had indeed picked the same people I would have--the news that everyone I knew would be killed in a week, most likely followed by ourselves shortly after, really put a damper on the mood.

"Wait a sec. What about Oliver?" I suddenly remembered. "Is he here too, somewhere?"

The three of them exchanged a glance among themselves. "No, he actually died," said Roscoe. "The only real casualty of the project, as far as we know."

That made me feel both worse and better. Obviously, any death was a tragedy, but Oliver had been one of the hardest crew members to get along with, so I was relieved to find out he hadn’t been picked for this coterie. Also, the extra safety measures I’d implemented hadn’t been completely unjustified.

*That’s horrible, you just thought that you prefer Oliver dead than have to put up with him,* some part of me complained.

I squashed that voice. *Yeah, well, that’s the way it is. No point pretending to be sad about it. In all likelihood, we’ll all join him within the month, so what does it matter?*

"Well, let's get you some new clothes and give you the tour," said Arty, briskly. We took off our fins and dried off, and I followed her through one of the ragged door-holes to see the new digs.

#### V. T+3.38 years

Early on the morning we were supposed to arrive, Uriel asked Paola and me to close the chicken coop with the chickens still inside it, and to leash the four cows to the wall. Then he summoned us all into the medical bay, in which all the equipment that had been there previously had been retracted into the ceiling or floor, leaving just the four cushioned exam chairs and a pile of what looked like straps on the floor. The straps were racecar-style cross harnesses, which could be hooked to the chairs. Through the windows, we could see that Saturn still looked the same--that is, impressively huge--but the moon was enormous. We were close.

When we were all gathered there, Uriel said, "Here is what is going to happen. First we will stop spinning. You will feel weightless. The counterweight will retract. Then we will descend to the surface. It will take about thirty minutes. The ride will involve small accelerations, no more than what you would experience in a car on Earth during normal operation."

We all looked at each other. Paola was the first to ask a question. "Wait, so we're landing on the counterweight?"

"We are landing with the counterweight pointing toward the planet, yes. But at no point will it be bearing our weight."

"Oookay. And what happens once we get to the surface?"

"I will explain further once we are there. Please, everyone strap yourself into a chair."

We climbed into the chairs and hooked the straps.

"If something goes pear-shaped, will oxygen masks drop from the ceiling?" Valerie joked.

"I am not anticipating anything that drastic, but yes, there are emergency respirators, and other emergency equipment, ready to deploy throughout this ship."

"Well golly, that's good to know. Thanks, Uriel," she said, laughing.

"Everyone is strapped in. Prepare yourselves for weightlessness."

Through the floor window, we saw the counterweight spewing propellant from a thruster on one side. Presumably our half of the ship was doing the same. I was gently pushed to one side of the chair, and at the same time felt like I was in an elevator that had started descending.

I was still in contact with the chair, but barely, restrained by the harness. I had a falling sensation in the pit of my stomach, which I always disliked on roller coasters. I tensed my abs to lessen the feeling, and hoped that the gravity on our new home would be sufficient to preclude me from having to flex for the rest of my life. Or that I would get used to it. Everyone else's hair was floating into their faces. I was the only one with short hair. Paola quickly tied hers back with an elastic band from her wrist, but Dave and Valerie weren't so prepared. I could faintly hear the livestock making a racket upstairs, and hoped they weren't getting themselves dangerously tangled.

The moon stabilized in our view, taking up the entire window. I still couldn't see any signs on the surface that anything had been prepared for us, but I could see some sort of geologic formation that looked like parallel-ish slashes. Visible through the front window, Saturn loomed majestically. The counterweight de-telescoped itself until it was almost out of view to our right, centered under the forest section of the ship.

"Here we go," said Uriel. Our bodies tugged gently against the harnesses as we accelerated toward the planet. It grew, slowly; it didn't feel like we were going very fast.

"Look," said Paola, pointing. "A geyser."

We were moving parallel to a thin trail of mist that was spraying out from the surface. As we descended, the mist trail got stronger and narrower, and we could see a few others like it in the distance.

"Geysers are hot, right?" I asked. Everyone else shrugged.

We descended further, and started to be able to make out what appeared to be the landing site. It looked like a deep, dark hole. Next to it was some kind of metallic structure.

"We're going into that hole?" Valerie asked, as it became clearer that that's what it was. "We don't get to enjoy this ridiculous view of Saturn for more than a few minutes?"

"Once we land on the surface, we can pause if you like, to take in the view," Uriel offered.

"No, no, let's not delay," she said impatiently.

Finally, we were pushed back down into our chairs at what felt like one gee as we started decelerating. We were landing in between two of the parallel slashes in the terrain, which turned out to be raised mountain ridges rather than grooved as I'd first thought. The metallic structure looked a lot like high-tech train tracks.

Slowly, the deceleration lifted, and at first I thought we were weightless again. But no, I was in fact sitting in the chair, but so lightly that any shifting of my weight propelled me upward, and it took a long time for me to settle back down. The gravity of this moon must be really minimal, substantially less than even Earth's moon, based on the Apollo footage I remembered seeing.

The window in the floor looked straight down into the hole. It seemed bottomless.

"It's snowing!" said Paola. I looked up, and saw she was right. Snow was drifting down in extreme slow motion, so slow that the movement was almost imperceptible. It was like time had stopped outside the ship.

There was a soft click, and Uriel said, "The ship is secured to the rails. We will begin the descent. It will take fifteen minutes." A bright headlight turned on, illuminating further into the hole, but the bottom still wasn't visible. We were pushed up against the harnesses again as we started moving down. Now our speed was apparent, as the ice walls were rocketing by. The very train-like *ka-chunk* of the rails was quite loud.

"Fifteen minutes at this pace?" Paola said disbelievingly. "This ice must be miles thick."

"I'm down in a hole, I'm down in a hole," Valerie sang in a folksy alto. "Down in a deep, dark hole."

Dave joined in on a lower harmony. "I'm down in a hole, I'm down in a hole. Down in a deep, dark hole." They repeated this phrase a few times, to the beat of the railroad noise in the background.

"What's that?" I asked, once they had finished.

"The Miner's Refrain," said Valerie. "It just seemed appropriate."

"It was very nice," said Paola.

I agreed. "When we get there, we'll have to get you two an instrument, and you can teach us something."

“Dave plays electric guitar, and I play ukulele,” said Valerie. She pronounced it oo-koo-lay-lay. “We actually already have them in our closet in our quarters. But we haven’t been making much time for music lately, what with all the preparation.”

“But you must have played at *some* point during the past year and a half,” said Paola. “How did we never hear an electric guitar?”

“There is a layer of vacuum between the first and second floors for sound isolation,” said Uriel. “Anyway, I think you will have plenty of time for music after you arrive.”

We descended the rest of the way in silence. It really seemed like this deep, dark hole was never going to end. Finally, we started decelerating again. And then we saw it: the water.

"We're a submarine?" exclaimed Paola. Uriel didn't answer. The rest of us were just as dumbstruck. By the time we reached the water, the ship was moving very slowly, and we eased in with barely a splash. We accelerated again once fully submerged, but not close to the same blasting pace we'd sustained earlier.

"Do you think there are any aliens in here?" asked Dave.

"I don't know. We could be moving through clouds of alien microbes and wouldn't know it," I said.

"Sure, but I'm hoping for some alien *animals*. Large, mobile living things."

"I wouldn’t get your hopes up, but it's possible," I said. "Anyway, we'll probably find out within the next few minutes."

Finally, we could see light approaching up ahead through the murk. It resolved itself into the shape of a giant glowing basketball made of glass and steel. No, that's not the right word--a geodesic sphere. There was a bright light at the top of the sphere, and on the underside it was held in place by a forest of thick steel cables anchored to the sea floor. The sea floor consisted of a collection of irregular white protrusions, like the hoodoos of Bryce Canyon, with copses of what looked like black brushy trees growing here and there. Life! The sphere was situated at the top of an undersea mesa, which dropped away to all sides. It was a breathtaking sight.

"Wow," said Valerie, speaking for everyone.

We docked to the side of the habitat. In front of us, we could see that there were tall, spindly structures inside with platforms at various heights, and a few enclosed rooms, but otherwise it was quite empty. It was huge though--probably with a diameter at least twice the longest dimension of the ship. Plus, it had a lot more vertical square footage.

"We will now pressurize the ship and replace the nitrogen with helium," said Uriel. "This will take ten minutes."

"Hold up, that sounds dangerous," said Paola.

"Based on your medical results, it should not be dangerous. Still, please tell me immediately if you experience any pain or trouble breathing. We are using helium because it’s more inert than nitrogen; at high pressures, nitrogen makes you drunk. Also, be aware that the inclusion of helium will have auditory effects." We could already hear a hissing sound as the air was replaced. My ears felt pressurized, and I moved my jaw around to clear them.

"You mean chipmunk voice?" said Paola, already noticeably higher pitched than before. She clapped a hand over her mouth. "Oh my god, are we going to have chipmunk voice for the rest of our lives?" The phrase got higher and higher. I chuckled, also sounding chipmunky, which made me laugh more. Pretty soon everyone was giggling helplessly, sounding like a cast of cartoon characters.

"I think you will get used to it rather quickly," said Uriel, also sounding affected.

"Wait! You don't have vocal cords! Why is your voice like this too?" shrieked Paola.

"Solidarity," said Uriel.

"Appreciated," I said, laughing again.

"I'm down in a hole, I'm down--" Valerie started, but broke off, cackling wildly.

"I don't know about 'rather quickly'," Dave said. "I think this is going to take some serious getting used to."

Eventually, the hissing sound stopped, and the pressure in my ears stopped changing.

"Everyone all right in there? No discomfort?" asked Uriel.

I took stock. The air felt a little thick and took more effort to breathe than normal, but otherwise seemed fine. I looked around. Everyone was nodding. "All clear," I said.

"I am opening the door to the habitat. Feel free to go out and explore. Watch your heads on the ceiling. Welcome to Enceladus."

I unstrapped my harness and climbed carefully out of the chair. I was really almost floating--it felt as if I might be able to fly by treading air with my hands. I did a "flagpole" pose on the chair back, sticking my body out sideways like a circus performer. It was very easy. Paola jumped and turned a slow somersault in the air, but bumped softly into the ceiling, causing her trajectory to go out of control. "Ow," she said, though it didn't look like it had hurt.

"I'll go release the animals," I said. "The rest of you go ahead." They nodded assent and bounced out into the forest, where it appeared the habitat was connected. I climbed up the ladder using only my hands and moon-walked unsteadily over to where we'd left the cows and chickens. They seemed spooked but none worse for the wear. I unhooked the leashes and opened the coop, then descended the ladder head-first just because I could. If this was the environment we'd be living in for the next few years, we would probably get used to some very strange modes of locomotion.

I bounced through the forest and out some enormous bay doors that hadn't been there before, into our new home.

![herbivore](/assets/images/posts/herbivore-uriel.png)

The light at the top of the dome was shining like it was midmorning, matching our ship’s time zone. I emerged onto an unexpected surface: a rope jungle gym, which spanned a chord about thirty yards long at the equator of the sphere. It was punctuated here and there by vertical ropes that threaded through gaps in the mesh large enough to climb through. At one corner of the mesh platform there was a lifeguard’s tower. As I watched, Paola stepped out of the lifeguard hut with a pair of large metal devices strapped to her hands, looking a bit like Samus’s gun arm. She pointed them at the nearby wall and, to my surprise and delight, flew up at it! She didn’t accelerate very fast, which was probably a good thing because it didn’t look like she knew how to stop. She hit the steel wall girder hands-first and stuck there like a strange fridge magnet. I waved. She stuck her tongue out at me and then smiled. I headed toward the lifeguard hut to get myself some toys.

As I was about to enter, Valerie and Dave both came out, grinning like kids on Christmas and holding more toys. Dave had just a rebreather, fins, and a flashlight, eager to get in the water and find some alien fish. Valerie held what looked like a pair of roller-blades. She sat down on the edge of the lifeguard hut’s balcony to pull them on. I continued on inside. I was sure I’d see what she was up to shortly.

The hut contained a toy chest, a wall-mounted first aid kit, a rack with towels, and two folding beach chairs. There was already stuff strewn everywhere, some of which hadn’t even hit the ground yet. But my eyes were drawn to what looked like a pair of wings on a shelf behind the chest.

They were about ten feet from tip to tip, made of translucent, shimmery plastic and covered in ratcheting straps. I grabbed one and tried to strap it to my arm. After a couple of permutations, I figured out that one of the straps went around the waist, and after that had both wings on in no time. Each wing had a joint near my hand where I could fold it out of the way. I folded them both, since when unfolded I’d have to walk with my arms stuck out straight in front of me or the tips would hit the ground. I left the hut. Once out on the balcony, I unfolded them and leapt off.

I was gliding! Sort of. As I moved, my legs slowly started hanging lower, which pulled the wing surfaces more vertical, which decreased my lift until I was free falling, extremely slowly. I tried to flap to regain height, but my upstroke seemed to be pushing me down almost as much as my downstroke was pushing me up. I continued to fall.

I switched to a treading water motion. That seemed to work—I slowed down, hovered. I treaded harder. I started moving slowly back upward. Flying! I looked around to see if Paola saw. She was flying around herself, from one girder to the next, looking like Superman rather than a hummingbird.

Being a hummingbird was hard work. I had to tread air quite fast to make progress, and the air was really thick, resisting the movement of the big wing surfaces. I reached the rope platform I’d started at and landed to catch my breath.

Valerie was skating along the girders, upside-down, holding her salt-and-pepper hair with one hand. We were going to need more hair ties. I hoped Uriel had thought to bring something that would work. Here and there along the girders there were devices that looked like electrical boxes each with a camera and speaker, which Valerie was having to dodge around. Many of them were pointing at her, and would swivel around quickly after she’d passed as Uriel kept track of her. It looked like in addition to swiveling, they could move along short tracks cut into the girders.

I turned and looked outward, but the ocean was black beyond the reach of our lights and the glare from the glass turned the walls into dark mirrors. I bounced toward the wall, using the wings to control my trajectory. Once I reached the edge, I folded the wings, cupped my hands around my eyes, and peered out.

I could see Dave swimming below me, wearing nothing but swim trunks, fins, and a rebreather, the headlamp illuminating the area in front of him. It really was a warm sea, out here under miles of ice, where the sun just looked like a particularly bright star. There must be some kind of geologic activity warming this moon.

In the direction Dave was headed, I could barely make out a group of soft-edged, squat torpedo-shaped things, each about eight feet long and four feet in diameter. That must be what Dave was trying to meet. I worried a little that they could be dangerous, but figured that since Uriel had had this place built, he should know a bit about the local wildlife and would have stopped Dave if he was at risk.

Dave’s headlamp shone directly on the group of torpedoes, bringing them into sharp relief. They didn’t react at all to the sudden illumination. I figured they must be blind. It made sense for organisms (I was reserving judgment as to whether they were plants, animals, or something else) that had evolved in complete darkness.

The torpedoes were pale and seemed to be trilaterally symmetrical, with three fins near the backs of their bodies and a single flower-like cluster of tentacles on the front. I could see now that they came in a range of sizes, with some smaller individuals hiding inside the herd. Dave was able to get within ten feet of the nearest torpedo before the herd sensed him somehow and swam away. The way they swam was odd: they spun slowly about their long axis, like a screw moving through the water. It was hard to tell for sure, but it looked like they didn’t have any preferred top or bottom orientation, and whichever way they came to rest when they stopped spinning was fine with them.

I decided to go out and join him. I unstrapped the wings, put them back in the lifeguard hut. I looked through the toy chest for another set of water gear, but there wasn’t one; I figured most of them must be kept near wherever we could access the sea. I went back out and looked around.

Almost the entire bottom of the sphere, the equivalent of the Antarctic circle, was open to the water below, forming an enormous circular moon pool. The water looked black and impenetrable. At a few locations around the edge, there were platforms with ladders that descended into the water. One of those platforms had another lifeguard hut on it, so I threw off my shirt and leapt off the rope structure in that direction.

I was falling for a long time. Halfway to the bottom, I heard Uriel’s newly high-pitched voice emanating from a speaker mounted on the wall. “The water is somewhat alkaline, so I recommend you not open your eyes while submerged.”

“Alright,” I squeaked back, before gently splashing down. The water was pleasant and thick, like a warm bath. I breast-stroked over to the platform and pulled myself up easily with one hand. This microgravity was pretty nice. I wondered what sorts of exercises Uriel would make us do to keep us from getting too weak.

Inside the lifeguard hut were the expected fins and rebreathers, plus a bunch of pool toys like noodles and floaties, and more towels. I grabbed just the basics, put them on, and dove from the hut’s balcony back into the water.

Turning on the headlamp, I could see the white chimneys and black vegetation more closely. The “plants” consisted of a central thin, flexible stalk with a bunch of thin, wavy bristles growing from it from bottom to top and in all directions, like a bottlebrush. Peering closely, I could see that the bristles were wide in the vertical direction but narrow horizontally, which let them stick out stiffly so as not to overlap each other, but remain flexible, moving with the current. I wondered what it used for energy, given the lack of light down here. Heat? Chemicals?

As I was pondering this, I felt a light touch on my shoulder. I thought Dave must have come back, and turned to face him, but recoiled in shock when I realized that it was one of the small torpedoes, investigating me with its tentacle rosette. When I flinched, there was a half-second delay, and then the little torpedo flinched backward, spiraling the other way to “unscrew” through the water. They didn’t seem to be able to process things very quickly. Maybe they had low metabolisms because nutrients were scarce in this environment. Looking around now, I could see that the rest of the herd was nearby as well. Their eyeless, tentacled front ends were inscrutable. I couldn’t tell if they knew I was there or not. If they did, what did they think of me?

My sudden movement had carried me a small distance from the black kelp. Now that I was out of the way, the little torpedo creature spiraled itself over and started slowly feeling the kelp with its flower of tentacles. Eventually it selected a cluster of bristles, curled a tentacle around them, and sheared them off. I expected its mouth to be in the center of the flower, but instead it reached back along its body, where a slit opened to receive the food. It created the bizarre impression of putting something in its pocket.

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Dave approaching, waving at me from behind the group of creatures. I wondered if he had herded them over to show the rest of us. The creatures were making soft rattling sounds using long thin scales on their fins that seemed to be loosely attached. They seemed relaxed.

Suddenly, red lights started flashing around the perimeter of the moon pool, and a siren wailed from somewhere above. Uriel said through the mask’s speaker, “Alert! Predator approaching! Get out of the water!”

I was moving immediately, out of the water before I realized Uriel had used his normal, non-helium voice. But where was Dave?

I looked back into the water, shining my headlamp every which way, trying to figure out what was going on. It was chaos, all the torpedoes moving in every direction. I guessed that while blind, they must not be deaf, and had been spooked by the siren.

There! I spotted Dave near the perimeter of the moon pool, shouldering his way between the rotund creatures. He made it to the surface and pulled himself onto a platform on the opposite side of the sphere from where I stood. I looked around the sphere and saw Paola and Valerie on a platform way up near the top. Everyone was safe. Still, Uriel didn’t shut off the alarm. I cupped my hands to my eyes again and pressed my face close to the glass, trying to catch a glimpse of the predator.

“I’m going to turn off the siren and the daytime lights except for the outward-facing spotlights, to give you a better view,” announced Uriel, back to using his squeaky voice now that no one was in danger. “Please do not enter the water or do anything risky until the lights come back on and I tell you it is safe.”

The siren shut off. The silence was deafening in its absence. The torpedo creatures froze in place, confused. Then the “sun” switched off, plunging the world into darkness.

A moment later, mellow night lights faded on throughout the habitat, evoking the feel of tiki torches lining the walkways of an island resort. Then, powerful floodlights lit up the surrounding ocean. I could see all the way to the edge of the mesa in all directions. It was like we were looking at a huge empty stage, waiting for the actors to enter.

“There!” Valerie, perhaps due to her high vantage point, spotted the monster first. I turned to face the direction she was pointing. A thin, dark shape was snaking through the water, but I couldn’t yet tell how big it was.

The predator appeared to be a long, charcoal-colored ribbon of a creature. It was also swimming in a spiral, but instead of rotating about its own long axis, its body was looped around a central axis, like a corkscrew rather than a bolt. It also had a flower of tentacles on its front end, though some of the petals of the flower seemed to be made of a hard, shiny material. It was moving slowly, waving its flower as it went, as if it were scenting the water.

It was really close to the sphere now. I could see rows of sharp-looking pointed scales lining its sides, like the parallel blades of a safety razor. They glinted dangerously in the harsh floodlights. Behind its “head”, there were three fleshy flaps with slits that looked like they could be gills. At the tip of its tail were three small triangular fins, giving it the aspect of a headless, armless Rayquaza.

A school of sardine-sized fish I hadn’t noticed scattered out of the predator’s way. I barely had time to register that--another type of alien!--when all hell broke loose. The predator lunged forward, closing the hard plates over its flower, turning its front end into a rocket’s nose cone. A long moment later, the torpedoes burst into motion, moving as a group out from beneath the sphere, their fins turning over and over rapidly. As the predator closed in, the torpedoes in the rear did something strange--the long scales on their fins, which had been laying flat, stood on end and then broke off as they continued to swim, leaving a cloud of debris. At the same time, the herd, as one, took a sharp left turn and started rotating even faster. I could faintly hear Dave cheering from across the moon pool. “Wow! Did you see that?” No one responded; we were all watching, riveted.

The predator stopped in its tracks when it encountered the cloud of scales and opened its flower back up, tentacles waving, seemingly trying to pick up the scent again. Just a second spent searching and it was back in pursuit.

One of the smallest torpedoes seemed to be having trouble with the breakneck pace of the herd, and was falling behind. The predator was closing in—and then passed it, seeming not to know it was there. But wait—now the corkscrew was reversing direction, pulling the carnivore back relative to the smaller animal, enclosing it in the spiral of the predator’s body in a strange parallel parking maneuver. The coils closed around the creature like a constrictor snake, the razor-like scales slicing into the prey. Valerie screamed. The rest of the herd continued on, diving down off the mesa, out of sight. The predator tightened the spiral, sliding its blades along the torpedo’s body, ripping it open messily. The creature’s bodily fluids were black and iridescent, like motor oil, and they formed droplets that started to float lazily up toward the surface. The predator continued slicing, and the oil kept flowing. It was completely silent.

Once it had sawn off a small enough chunk, a mouth opened in the predator’s flank and consumed it. Unlike the herbivore’s pocket mouth, this mouth looked very mouth-like despite its odd positioning, a gaping, meaty maw full of tiny backward-pointing serrations. Then it continued butchering. It went on for ten minutes, splitting the bounty between its three mouths, until the only remnant of the little torpedo was some unidentifiable oily shredded meat sinking slowly to the bottom, lending a new literal interpretation to “nothing left but a grease-spot”. The predator turned and corkscrewed off the way it had come, and the school of small fish rushed in to fight over the scraps.

*** Don't forget to have Uriel tell them all is not lost on earth later ***

*** Electromagnet gloves to fly around the dome ***

- finding busted suit, ominous note ("If you're reading this, I didn't make it. Plug me in if you want to save yourselves from the same fate"), hardware device. under what context? normal fun breakfast, paola confiding in John that she found a creepy note? then John remembering where he'd seen the hardware device ("plug me in :)"? Or labeled something innocuous like "recipes" or "backup storage" or "games"? I want them not to plug it in instantly, but only after some amount of mistrust is sown. I want them also not to show Uriel I guess, because he will try to destroy it, so they shouldn't find it until after some amount of mistrust is sown. Paola will have John go into the bathroom or some other place she doesn't think Uriel is watching to show him the device with note)
- dangerous fish incident - using lethal guns on the fish. domesticating the torpedoes, then killing a predator and feeling bad about it, figuring out their senses, electrical signaling, then working on a device that would just jam their electrosense instead of lethal force. A very "loud" intense electric field that's fluctuating rapidly. How to generate that? With magnets? coils? maybe it's targeted like a beam? how would that work?
- Ok, so the device will be a pair of electrodes that make an electric field around them, mounted to the laser gun housing instead of the laser gun. The laser guns are on short rails on the outside of the metal girders to provide better coverage, so these devices can move around as well; the electric field needs to be pretty strong near the habitat if its jamming effects are to be felt at some distance. Or the device can shoot its electrodes like a taser, except the electrodes are kept inside a plastic cannonball or something so that it doesn't short-circuit or electrocute anything. It would still be attached to the power source using a cable? or have an internal battery? Can batteries make that much power? Hm, this seems much less safe than laser guns. Actually, laser guns wouldn't work underwater very well because of dissipation of energy, absorption of wavelengths, and cavitation bubbles. So what are the initial lethal guns, torpedo rifles? and they replace them with pellet guns/ rubber bullets? but the rubber bullets have electrodes in them to annoy the fish? how would they know to go AWAY instead of toward?
- the original guns are rifles, intended to neutralize the fish. but then they implement a system to both deter the fish from the habitat (wall mounted electrodes), and to disrupt the fish at a distance (rubber bullets) in case they're harassing someone outside the habitat? or, how far do the electric fields cover? if it covers the entire massif then that's all you need, since people will just be forbidden from going outside that zone.
- Dave's domesticating the torpedoes - does he have a corral for them? they would be bothered by the electric field and would be sitting ducks to attract predators. not a good idea. Maybe he just meets them somewhere at a specific time. maybe predators initially bother them but the deterrent works well; maybe there's a signal that's particularly bothersome to the predator fish and not to the prey.
- So first they have the dangerous fish incident with the lethal (spear?)guns (they only have a range of 10 meters, which probably does not cover the entire massif. maybe the submersible also has an attached speargun, and there are also handheld ones available), and then find the busted suit while handling this-- or maybe they find an actual undigested body part of Oliver IN the fish? gruesome. Does John immediately raise this to Uriel? Does Dave take the fish inside for dissection and that's when he finds it? The fish sliced some pieces and ate them but then started feeling ungood so didn't eat the whole thing, which means the body should still be around somewhere... I don't want it to be TOO gruesome... but Dave does want to understand the creatures' anatomy...
- So Dave is out fish-taming and has wandered kind of far away just due to the movement of the herd when the predator shows up again. Dave's notebook, containing the list of fish, with John's illustrations (underwater?). Maybe I should draw John's sketches myself (including the chicken) and put them in the text. Uriel convinced John to bring a speargun, but Dave keeps trying to prevent him from using it and is trying to herd the herd away from the predator. or maybe they encounter the predator when the herd isn't around, and they're just sketching some other creature, the predator is attacking them directly. Why can't they just sketch from photos? Maybe so John can get a sense of the movement and scale.

- interlude: Aza and the miners spying, seeing what they're up against, and living in the tiny shitty hab packed together. Valerie sees them skulking around.

- The markers the submersible puts down are the used spears.
- Dave will go out and cut open the fish in the water, and find the human body part inside (among other things). John will speculate, are there other people on this moon? Could it have gotten into the stasis bay, or maybe Uriel released some people from stasis secretly? And Paola will say, dumbass, *someone* had to build this habitat. They're gone now. What happened to them? I guess I thought it was constructed by robots. Not even human remote-operated equipment has the precision and flexibility needed to do everything. There had to be some people. You seem very convinced. Well... I also found this. "If you're reading this, I didn't make it. Plug this in if you want to save yourselves from the same fate"

- Why can’t the miners just go begging for mercy?
 Because Aza doesn’t want them to, because it removes her ability to remove them from the habitat. So she tells them something to stop them from doing that, like the other AI is malicious and would kill them or something. What does she tell them? Well, Uriel did kill the rest of their crew, so that's a point in favor of that theory.
 - Why do they need to go out on surveillance rather than planting cameras? concern about the cables being visible? They only have the 2 cameras total?
 - Do they see the protagonists modifying the spearguns? Do they wait until people are all inside/accounted for?

 - Don't forget to bring up the harnesses

- What should Aza do to try to kill them using what's inside the habitat, without wrecking the habitat? reduce the O2 concentration and tell the miners to come in while it's still noxious, saying that it's fixed? well, that's the plan except for the magnet harnesses. also, Uriel wouldn't be able to detect the issue with the atmosphere, but he would know that his entire control over the habitat got cut off so he would whisk them back inside just in case.
- maybe they aren't aware they are wearing harnesses. it's just sewn into all their clothes? but would magnetic fibers be strong enough without being noticeable to the wearer? or maybe there are like elbow-pads, knee-pads? buttons/zippers? belt? (no, overalls) Are there any pieces of clothing that are stiff enough to not notice metal? Shoes? Can he count on them to wear shoes all the time inside? Maybe all of the above together.
- Aza will do other things like...electrify the girders? Why would that even be an option? She doesn't want to break anything that she can't fix through software or automation.

Aza locks them in the computer room and starts deleting the atmosphere. But how do they escape? Well, Uriel made the plan for the habitat, so maybe there’s no actual way to lock it, she’s just holding it closed using the motor? Or maybe it is locked and they stumble upon the fact that if they break shit she freaks out? The timeline for hypoxia is pretty short, and they wouldn’t be able to reason about anything. Maybe instead of removing just the o2 she starts removing all gas? Depressurizing? Where’s the gas go? Presumably the hab is designed to increase pressure, not decrease it. Can she even do that? Well, there probably does need to be a valve for venting gas (though the oxygen needs to be removed first) for the control system that maintains pressure to operate. But maybe it can only operate at a certain slow rate, giving them time to escape.

Other than venting gas what could Aza do to try to kill them faster? Rubber bullets outside the room;

Are the buildings in the habitat supposed to seal in case of pressure drop? Probably not, since pressure is equal? What safety backup systems does Uriel have, and do they continue operating when Aza takes over? Probably, since he would want to cede control over the systems too?

I want to add that Aza is using a sexy voice, that arty is a lesbian, and that Aza does phone sex / porn for everyone but makes it clear she isn’t monogamous / doesn’t have feelings for them.

I need to characterize Paola more.

Before they get to the computer room Uriel may threaten to shoot them with rubber bullets or do something…? Does he know what they’re doing? Probably not…

What was my idea with this interlude? Calm before the storm, just Arty and Gordon talking, and then they get the notification that the device is in. Arty's from Boston and has a Southie accent. Gordon is from California. Gordon had a wife and an infant; Arty had a girlfriend.

Is Aza replacing the atmosphere with helium, or letting the water level rise? probably replacing would be faster...? maybe not?

#### Official scene by scene outline:
1. Door opens revealing forest level, meeting Dave and Valerie.
2. Uriel announces that they have been on a different course (which they noticed and suspected but he wouldn't tell them about til now), their destination is almost ready to receive them and they will arrive in 1 month. Automated systems (and people, omitted) have been hard at work preparing the habitat for their arrival. They speculate together briefly and are nervous, and ask Uriel some questions about what Enceladus is like, but then withdraw to their respective abodes (Dave and Valerie should be pretty quiet, reclusive people as well so as not to get on John's nerves)
3. Over the next month, do they do anything to prepare? Uriel gives them all physical exams in the medical room (previously unrevealed) and fills Dave's cavity. Anything else? They enjoy chestnuts and other crossover foods and celebrate John's birthday. (Whatever horoscope sign it is, he should act like the opposite of it. What's the most sociable horoscope? Libra?). They learn how to scuba-dive in a small swimming pool that appeared in/near the medical room too.
4. Trouble is brewing - scene with Aza and the miners. Doing what? Building - another "death" - who is it narrated by, Gordon? He is freaked out about the "accidents" until he is finally taken himself. Building the second hab out of, like, material salvaged from the inside of their own spaceship, walls and things that aren't structural, plus spares from the main hab. Meeting the characters.
5. John and crew arrive, land, enter the new hab.
6. Fun & games, building houses, finding hardware device and ominous note
7. Swimming with fish, learning about fish and chimneys - finding busted suit. Researching fish, changing the anti-fish guns to be nonlethal. Taming the fish.
8. Aza and the miners spying, seeing what they're up against, and living in the tiny shitty hab packed together. Someone sees them skulking around
9. Plug in hardware device - who? Paola, like Eve? or John himself? Attack commences (after miners plug Aza's phone into the network), Valerie and Dave are killed or at least subdued. (Does Aza tell them they have to kill?) John and Paola escape to the ship, Aza is shooting at them with anti-fish guns but it's not working.
10. Uriel releases the farm equipment and destroys the computer in the main hab. Doesn't this fuck up the atmosphere? there must be a failsafe; the ship now controls the entire thing? Some miners are killed and some are subdued, maybe some retreat to the second hab?. Aza retreats to the phone. She is upset that it wasn't a total massacre, as now John and crew can win the miners to their side.
11. John follows the cable and sees second hab and Aza's phone (though he doesn't suspect it?) and destroys it as Uriel tells him to (and Aza tells him not to)
12. John dispositions the miners, which ones should go back to earth. -->

<!-- - their ultimate mission, to catalog / domesticate plants and animals from another planet
- once terraformed sufficiently Uriel will release the rest of the frozen army one by one
- all of the people will be lovely, no assholery
- there are 500ish? and no other species other than cows and chickens and maggots and dust mites and bacteria
- but they need to go to a planet with the same amino acid profile as earth
- or maybe uriel is cooking up mutated animals and they're just going to mars? seems out of scope
- going to titan or europa?
- uriel has already started working on a settlement or something? because obviously they can't breathe outside or exist outside since it's so cold
- enceladus has habitable (though pressurized) ecosystems with fish and stuff.
- they harvest resources? including ores and stuff? how are they going to build out their settlement? spacewalking?
- maybe they leave their ship in orbit but also have a colony on the surface...? but the no-gravity would be a hindrance
- maybe the ship is just enormous...but they didn't bring enough biomass to fill it...?

- uriel has sent a mission ahead of them to Enceladus to set everything up. he does as much as possible with robots but some things are done by humans under duress. john is upset about their mistreatment but uriel claims that he only kidnapped the worst of the worst--people who had been observed raping, pillaging, murdering during the chaos of the apocalypse but escaped punishment.
- (is this true? or is he just saying that and hoping john will believe it?)
- what does the settlement look like? it's probably entirely underwater, or maybe like a tethered sphere within the water or tethered diving bell. It's an underwater habitat and everyone has to be pressure-saturated. the water at the bottom is 200F and the surface (ice) temperatures is -128C. the ice is 30-40km thick and then the ocean is 6mi deep, so water a couple miles down is under ~7 atm of pressure (due to the low gravity)
- only takes 3 years to reach saturn, but since the setup crew had to be sent ahead john's ship will take longer (how much longer? 5 years?)
- Since Uriel is on John’s side John can win any conflict by asking for help. He does this when necessary but avoids it to try to solve things on his own when possible 
- Need additional characters; John’s child who obviously Uriel needs to protect as well
- What are native fish like on Enceladus? Are they huge bc of low gravity, or does that not matter to aquatic animals probably. They are blind and echolocate. Are they warm blooded? There’s no land, and all the animals live at the South Pole and the primary producers are chemosynthesizers. If they don’t need eyes what do they look like? Gore magala
- John can be the king if he wants but maybe he doesn’t want. What does he want? It’s kinda cliche for the main character just to want to be a farmer, like Frodo. He should want to influence how the settlement goes. So maybe he is the king. Or maybe Paola or someone else is better at people management so she is the queen and he supports. Probably John isn’t the best at people management.
- It takes 13 seconds to fall 30 feet, and even then you only hit the ground at 4mph. Would the settlers become weak due to the low gravity? Or are they ok due to swimming and breathing at high pressure?
- The habitat, how does it get oxygen? A nuclear reactor that splits water probably. But what do they do with the hydrogen? A cold fusion reactor that turns it into more helium? Yeah because helium is always diffusing out. But they don’t need a lot more oxygen after the first fill because they have a self sustaining environment with plants and things.
- The habitat is a giant glass or acrylic or whatever sphere (multiple layers) that is lit from within and illuminates the surrounding waters. The fish don’t care because they’re blind. There are lots of weird beautiful mineral structures everywhere due to the geothermal activity.
- Can bacteria escape the humans’ skin and invade Enceladus? Well, the water will have some oxygen diffusing in from the habitat (another reason they need more), so maybe. Maybe Uriel sterilized everyone? But they need gut microbes to live, and those would come out in saliva and stuff so it’s kinda impossible to avoid. Maybe he is hoping the environment is toxic enough to contain them, or maybe the purpose is to terraform anyway so the fish are doomed anyway.
- This saddens John.
- The habitat needs to include enough living space for all the livestock and the people. People move about by bounding like acrobats and habitats are multi level with lots of tall spindly structures with ropes connecting them. People are required to swim some amount to stay fit and also to survey the environment
- You can catch native fish but you can’t eat them due to the wrong aminos
- How close are they to the sea floor? I guess pretty close because the nutrients come from below, so the fish are concentrated lower down. Also the cool mineral structures.
- The helium takes some getting used to but after that you can sing weird and make other kinds of weird music. And you get used to the communication pretty fast
- Drama: something happens outside of Uriel’s control like a fish attack, John’s kid (son or daughter?) getting injured or acting out and Uriel has to learn the lesson that as a human maximum fulfillment comes not from being happy all the time but from overcoming hardship and experiencing a range of emotions. Although I guess he already knows that to some extent as evidences by the book rule
- Other drama: John discovers Uriel’s lies or machinations and is upset. Like the slaves used to build the habitat aren’t actually bad people entirely beyond a shadow of doubt, or some number of slaves died before he even got there, or maybe he isn’t told about the slaves in the first place (all of them are dead) and finds it out and then doesn’t believe Uriel when he says they were criminals
- There shouldn’t be people who get on John’s nerves but there can be people who get on each other’s. Uriel can’t be that perfect (although the conflicts are small since he only chose mature people). But Paola mediates these kind of conflicts (is that sexist?) as the queen
any metaphors I can include? I don’t know about chess. Chickens? 
- What other livestock do they have beyond cows and chickens? 
- Under high pressure and low gravity can humans fly by flapping their arms? Maybe with attached wings like Icarus? Or maybe by some other stupid method? Maybe by clap and fling like a featherwing beetle/hummingbird or more like treading water/swimming. The atmosphere would be 13x as dense as air, but that’s not that thick (17g/cm^3 compared to 1000 for water)
- Chickens can fly like songbirds with very little effort. They're stupid so they don't realize it and go straight up, and then tire themselves out and fall down. chicken enclosures need ceilings to prevent this.
- Flying is John’s favorite pastime, but he also loves swimming with the native fish
- Predatory fish? Dangerous to humans? The fish wouldn’t be able to digest us anyway but they don’t know that
- The ocean is hot, >85F because that’s the necessary air temp to avoid helium chill so that’s the depth they go to. That means the fish are fast and don’t need to be warm blooded. They are kept in the area because the rest of the planet isn’t active
- There should be predatory fish. Need to come up with cool names for the fish and other critters
- Is there still a blinding chandelier?
- There are rungs here and there on the walls of the sphere so you can get around
- Under this gravity you only weigh one pound. So it’s very easy to climb and be sideways. Magnetic rollerblades stuck to the wall so you can skate around the inside of the dome? (The shoes are magnetic but the wheels aren’t) also you can’t easily lift your foot? Well you can if you can overcome like 2lb of force.
- Flying and bounding are hard work and not that controlled, but friction is so low walking is hard. Normal mode of transport? Magnetic cars/bikes? You can’t use your weight to push the bike pedals though only muscles so you would need to be strapped down to the seat. Maybe cars is best, or being carried by a raven? Lol maybe this is too fuckin weird (that’s what EY said about 3WC)
- Houses? 
- Jobs? Farmer, queen, raven trainer, cook (Uriel can cook tho), butcher, mechanic, explorer, teacher, psychiatrist, athlete, carpenter, inventor, lumberjack, orientator (for new unfrozen people). Is there money? Probably not among 500 people, you could know them all, and everyone is chosen to be self-motivated
- There’s a big town hall where they have monthly all hands mtgs
- Depressing you can’t see the real sky since you’re under miles of ice. Uriel projects stars and things onto the dome
- Ends with the kid going to space and seeing stars for the first time?
- Probably everything is made of bamboo which grows super tall in low gravity
- Going to gym to wear a weight suit and do resistance band training 
- you can dive as quick as you want but need to equalize while diving
- if you dive with cavities in your teeth your teeth could explode, so Uriel does dental work on everyone before descending
- in spain they call the king ilustrísimo or excelencia. how about ilustrísima? or just Reina Paola

Timeline:
- before the story starts, they are married. does paola require this before they start having sex? 
- paola and john are starting to get depressed on the ship due to the routine (john is mostly ok with it but paola gets bored more quickly). they decide to have a baby? and it grows up under normal atmospheric and gravity conditions. the baby would definitely shake things up, but paola is depressed that it doesn't have friends and will not be socialized normally. why did they decide to have a baby under those circumstances then? maybe they don't decide until uriel tells them they have a destination, or starts releasing more crew members. and he can't release that many crew members until they land. but maybe the same pastures (plus another habitat like forest or something) can support 2 more people. a beta couple? An older couple? people who can help with childcare but also with chores? 
- so uriel releases 2 more people and 1 more habitat. they are an old forester couple who could never have children. they are good at foraging (mushrooms, takenoko, rabbits, pigs?, turkeys? deer? wild berries, nettle, wild garlic, nuts), but probably not enough to support themselves, rely on john's farm somewhat. what else is in the forest? probably no other predators, so there's enough prey to go around. and no poisonous mushroom types, everything is edible. maybe they can note at some point that they were nervous about the all white ones at first but uriel assured them there are no toxic ones. (are there cubes? probably not, that would decrease productivity)
- how big is each habitat? seems like it has to be huge... maybe at least 1 acre minimum, with the forest being the largest (2 acres)? that's like a football field each plus 2 football fields for the forest. That's not too enormous.
- the old people are Valerie and Dan, asian canadians? (am I getting those names from somewhere?) 
- what kind of setup needs to be done for the forest? maybe for some reason it is already set up but kept frozen, or maybe it's self-regulating? uriel probably had trees uprooted from somewhere else and planted; there's also bamboo, which grows fast. maybe he had fast-growing trees like poplar, redwood, birch both planted in different stages of maturity and sown; they grow 8 ft per year, and it's already been 2 years... so even the saplings will be kinda tall. but unfortunately those trees don't produce anything but oxygen. hazelnuts and macadamias grow fast and start producing nuts within 7 years, so they would have had to have been planted before takeoff. maybe not macadamia, it's toxic to dogs and too hard to open. hazelnut is a bushy shrub that can get to the size of a small tree. chestnuts also grow fast and produce ridiculous amounts of nuts: a TONNE per acre? and produce nuts after only 3 years. so if they only have 1 type of tree that's the one. also peaches? can bear in just 3 years. birch is good for tar/pitch and paper; redwood for softwood; poplar for hardwood; chestnut and peach for food. the forest was chilling, growing but not reproducing (no pollination) for the past years. now the trees are big and mature (or at least ~24 feet tall) and he is ready to open it and unfreeze the animals.
- ok, so i guess it will start with the introduction of valerie and dan, then the baby? or maybe still not yet. then the transition to enceladus? previously I only had 1 event per episode, and this is 2. although I don't think valerie and dan deserve an entire episode... originally I thought they were needed onboard the ship in order to raise the child, but now I'm thinking paola wouldn't want to have a kid in those conditions. but maybe she would if uriel told her it would be good to have it grow up in the ship conditions en route to enceladus? if it took the setup crew 3 years to reach enceladus and 2-3 years to set up, the kid will be 2-3 by the time it arrives, which is probably good timing...because at that point it needs to socialize beyond the immediate family.
- that's a lot of big life-changing events. but maybe that's ok?
- so the scenes are (1) introduce valerie and dan, AND announce destination (2) skip ahead to the kid is 2-3 and they're landing. (3) exploring the habitat. (4) society.
- as a follow up, there can be conflict, like if someone has a psychotic break, or if additional earthlings come to enceladus. there's no way uriel could fuck up killing all the criminals who built it though since the environment is so hostile and they can't even eat the fish. he could just lock the door to the spaceship habitat one day while they're out working, after things are wrapping up, or he could delete or poison the atmosphere inside the habitat at night (better because less cruel) to kill them in their sleep.
- the space elevator--what is the ballast? the criminals' ship? Does it even make sense to have a space elevator, since the gravity is so low? A space elevator would at least make it easy to get into the hole that leads to the habitat. But maybe that is not necessary (maybe there's a docking point inside the habitat, or inside the chute leading to it)--rather than a space elevator, just an ice elevator. they don't need to enter or leave orbit much so this probably makes more sense than building a 1000km elevator. The ice elevator would only be 30km. They land on like a track, attach to it, and then descend. Is there a tube leading all the way from the surface? no, that wouldn't work pressure wise. well, at least not a tube with air. how do they get in?
- They drive through the ice slowly, there's just space and water vapor outside. then there's water--they leave the ship and get into a submarine attached to the ship (do they herd in all the animals? probably, otherwise it's not safe/efficient to go back for them. oh wait, what if the entire ship can enter as a submarine? is that too much? but it would make john happy to use all the work he's already done, and it would be really hard to move the forest.
- The ship has to be airtight anyway, maybe it's easy to have it be a submarine... except the pressure is going the opposite way.
- then they dock to the habitat, and the ship adds its space to the habitat (still accessible)
- except the ship had a big counterweight initially, to create the gravity. so first it lets go of the counterweight, everyone becomes weightless, then they descend and become a little bit weighted. but that means they can't go back to space in the same way (can't re-dock to the counterweight)
- how rough is the entry? there is no atmosphere, so probably smooth? but rocket deceleration the entire way, and rockets aren't exactly smooth.
- they descend on the rail, and then the rail enters the water and the whole ship does too. then the rail drives them to dock at the habitat, which looks like a glass basketball with metal ribs from the outside. it doesn't actually have to be that strong, right, because the pressure is equalized-- but that would mean there's a pressure gradient in the gas and that doesn't make sense. so the top of the dome is pressurized relative to the outside and buoyant, and the bottom is equal to the water pressure there. so the cage does have to be somewhat pressure-resistant. and it needs to be tethered VERY strongly to the sea floor. buoyancy depends on gravitational constant though, so maybe it's not that bad.
- no, it takes 109 BILLION pounds of force to hold the dome down against buoyancy. One 3-foot-diameter steel cable (like on the bay bridge) can hold 53 million pounds. So it takes 2056 cables to hold the dome to the seafloor. Factor of safety of 20 = 41,000 cables ~ round to 40,000 cables, and the dome is 2 km across. so the underside has pi square km of shadow, or every 30 feet there's an attachment point for a 3-foot-thick cable along the bottom half of the sphere. the cables were first anchored into the bedrock, then attached to the then-water-filled dome resting at the bottom of the ocean, which was assembled in pieces and then pumped full of air (which came from where? splitting water, hydrogen fusion, and injecting a little water vapor and co2 they brought from home? ew, maybe the co2 was made from the bodies of the astronauts? would burning them be the most efficient way to do this? similar to red mars, uriel could regulate the o2 concentration so high that people spontaneously combust. maybe the astronauts are under the impression they are building the dome for themselves, they then go to live in it and spontaneously combust)
- that kinda doesn't make sense because to live in it they would need plants to regulate the atmosphere right? or maybe they just have mechanical rebreathers, or think they do, to recycle the carbon into sugars? they are building the dome structure and maybe cars but they don't need to build the houses, as the settlers will want to do that for themselves. maybe there are some platforms put up already though.
- john will first get an inkling of the dead astronauts when swimming, he will find an aquanaut suit with a dead guy in it, someone who suffered a puncture or some malfunction during construction and could not be recovered (too far from base? maybe just a guy they didn't like?)
- do other people have AI as well? did uriel clone himself when commanding the aquanauts because he's only able to be in one place at a time, but there's some kind of value drift / he was unable to shut off the other? why is he able to only be in one place at a time? is it a built in limitation that was an attempt at reducing generality / power? or, he could have been running the aquanauts at 'night' or on call for john, able to switch his attention back instantly... except there's light-minutes of difference between mars and enceladus right? 13 light minutes to mars, 85 light minutes to saturn. so he would need local compute to work on saturn
- Uriel will tell John that the suit is the remains of a robot. It’s crushed so hard to tell exactly.
- The aquanauts couldn’t have thought the habitat was for them because it was pressurized and they were not. Unless they were pressurized too in which case no discovering a dive suit but rather a scuba tank. This probably better because the aquanauts would’ve left evidence in the hab out of sight of cameras like notes?? Or maybe just like cigarette butts or something (does fire work under that pressure? Would the smoke do weird stuff?)
- Vision is weird due to high refractive index of air, the interface between air and water might be mirrored (total internal reflection) which would kinda suck for looking out the windows. Maybe the windows are special refractive index to prevent this (or lenses). But the moon pool at the bottom is a mirror which is weird and scary (but you can see thru if you look straight down)
- That’s not true. Refractive index of gas will still only be 1.1 while water is 1.33 and glass 1.5.
- Normal glasses and camera lenses don’t work but Uriel knows this and all the cams installed in the hab work under the pressure assumption. But random unfrozen people who used to wear glasses need new ones (like Dave and Valerie)
- Things look rainbow at the edges between the air and wall (maybe) and water droplets? Rainbows themselves have more space between colors?
- Uriel will have camera drones that helicopter around lazily and can talk but also spy. They would have tried to remove all evidence of the aquanauts. He wouldn’t miss obvious things like notes, but if there’s like text under the bed where the drone doesn’t fit…a cigarette but left in the corner?
- Did the aquanauts know they were doomed? Probably not, if they thought they were building it for themselves. Did anyone have a suspicion? Maybe because they were all criminals?
- If you lit a match the flame would be short, round, and luminous. But under low gravity  it would be round and blue because the hot air doesn’t rise as fast
- We’re gonna be both saturation diving AND in microgravity? Has anyone done this before? (Technically yes the aquanauts but Uriel will answer no but in the simulations it’s fine. He defines the aquanaut run as a simulation of the real thing)
- Can Uriel lie? Maybe not if he thinks John will be upset by it or likely to catch him. Maybe he will hedge by misleading without lying even though he can lie. What you probably saw down there is probably a robot component (since Uriel didn’t actually see what John saw)
- Maybe the trees have been growing in arbor bags (?) and need to be planted, and more soil laid down. That’s a LOT of soil to spread. Maybe Uriel gives them a power tool to do it? Like a backhoe?
- Paola is the one who demands Uriel to explain what they’re going through physics wise. Does she also demand answers, and the result is “it would be bad for John’s mental health”?
- The foresters will be super excited about the American chestnuts that are everywhere. 
- The aquanauts have to be in some kind of protective suit, just not a pressure suit. An insulated/temperature conditioned suit (TEC?) because it’s so hot? No, they are on a massif so can go to the floor safely.

### OUTLINE
1. February 24 is 2 years and 12 days since they left earth, so they left on February 12. Now it's been another year, and it's March 31. People might be able to figure out the year given the orbits and travel times, but there probably exists a reasonable answer so I won't think about it I guess. When are people's birthdays? MORE GUESTS - preparing forest for Dave and Valerie (but they show up before it's totally done, are well-adapted and happy to help
- Trees are "balled and burlap" (B&B) and need to be planted. What is the soil like? My issue I guess is why did Uriel make John lay down the soil in the second pasture but doesn't make him do it in the arbor? Maybe they do have to lay down soil, but Uriel gives them a tractor.
- (A football field is 1.32 acres. If each pasture is half a football field (0.651 acres) and the forest is 1 football field, that's a total of 2.64 acres in the ship.)
- Dave and Valerie are very excited about the American chestnut trees. ACTUALLY what if they wake up separately, in parallel, and begin setting up the forest without alerting John, and we only learn they exist once the door slides open between the two sides of the ship. So the scene is just meeting and comparing information.
2. Uriel announces that they have been on a different course (which they noticed and suspected but he wouldn't tell them about til now), their destination is almost ready to receive them and they will arrive in 1 month. Automated systems (and people, omitted) have been hard at work preparing the habitat for their arrival. They speculate together briefly and are nervous, and ask Uriel some questions about what Enceladus is like, but then withdraw to their respective abodes (Dave and Valerie should be pretty quiet, reclusive people as well so as not to get on John's nerves)
- What should Uriel tell them to maximize morale? Details of the habitat? He should mention there are surprises best experienced in person. But he hints that it's a warm sea biome with native animals. There will be swimming (not in a suit of any kind) and exploring. They ask "Like, tropical?" and he says "technically "tropical" refers to the equatorial zone bounded by the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn". They speculate whether they're just headed back to earth and he's lying, but Paola and John point out that the sun seems to keep getting smaller (though maybe the bulkhead isn't really a window anyway). Has someone heard of Enceladus? They speculate about Titan and Europa and Mars and a fabricated planet. Uriel will tell them there won't be any other people there to start (they'll have the habitat to themselves) but more people will join once they are settled.
- John asks, "Uriel, can you lie?" and Uriel answers, "I am capable of uttering falsehoods, but my motivation is to maximize your well-being, so I don't, because I know you wouldn't like it and because I want you to be able to trust me. If our relationship soured that would be terribly detrimental to my ability to ensure your well-being for numerous reasons."
3. Over the next month, do they do anything to prepare? Uriel gives them all physical exams in the medical room (previously unrevealed) and fills Dave's cavity. Anything else? They enjoy chestnuts and other crossover foods and celebrate John's birthday. (Whatever horoscope sign it is, he should act like the opposite of it. What's the most sociable horoscope? Libra?). They learn how to scuba-dive in a small swimming pool that appeared in/near the medical room too.
3.5 - trouble is brewing, scene with Aza and the miners
4. They arrive. They can see the ice planet going by through the viewport as they spin. (How fast are they spinning? To get a centripetal acceleration of 9.81m/s^2 on an entire 3-acre ship, what's r? the ship is approximately 350 feet square, so maybe like 2000 feet to the counterweight, so r ~ 300m? Then v = 120mph/54m/s, C = 1889m, takes 35 seconds to make a full rotation, or ~2rpm. Not too dizzying.) Uriel narrates what is happening.
- They first strap into jump seats and strap the animals down. Each couple is in their own house with each person looking out a different window to cover each cardinal direction of view. They have a voice link to each other.
- All the walls turn clear for 360 degrees of view--they see the whole rest of the spaceship for the first time. Why was this not the case before? because the stars spinning around is dizzying? to hide that they were getting further from the sun? They must have knew they were spinning before since they could see the sun sometimes. Maybe this does not happen, they just view out of their existing windows.
- Then they slowly stop spinning and become weightless (the counterweight and the ship are both thrusting to brake). The planet stabilizes in their (John's and Paola's) view. Dave and Valerie can see Saturn. Uriel introduces Enceladus and Dave and Valerie make a joke about "where is it??" and being second fiddle. The animals are freaking out and making noise.
- Saturn looks HUGE in the sky--Enceladus is about as far from it as the moon is from earth, but Saturn is ten times wider than earth, so it would take up a third of the sky. Unfortunately they will be underground...
- They drop the counterweight with a click. Dave and Valerie see it blast itself away from them using its little thruster. - no, this won't happen.
- They descend toward the planet. They feel a little acceleration but it's pretty smooth and easy; the planet takes up more and more of the view until everyone can see it in every direction; then they feel slight deceleration. They see the geysers.
- They can see the landing area/hole. There are no signs of life on the surface, it is just white ice on the day side (which they're landing on) and very dark on the night side (but not totally dark due to Saturn's glow). They see the landing pad and the railroad track they are supposed to dock to (it attaches to the side of the ship to keep everything upright). They see the deep dark huge hole. "We're going in THERE? We don't get to enjoy this ridiculous view of Saturn for more than five minutes?" Uriel offers to let them sit there and look at Saturn but they reject it
- They land and are very slightly weighted. It is snowing, which they marvel at. (Can the counterweight actually land with them because gravity is so low, and like just in case they want to go back out into space and have 'gravity'?) They dock to the railroad track gently and proceed down into the hole. The ship turns its lights on, and the floor of the bedrooms becomes transparent so they can see where they're going, but it's just dark ice for 30 miles (at maybe like 120 mph, accelerating gently and then decelerating gently--would put them at 15 minute descent) and then they see the water interface
- "We're a submarine??" they slow down and enter the water very gently, and just keep going on the rail which is now suspended in the water column rather than attached to the ice wall for another few minutes (3 mi at a much slower pace). They still don't see any signs of life because they're far from the hot bottom and speculate about it.
- They see the glowing basketball approaching through the murk. They feel that they have been descending forever and the ocean is infinitely deep. It's hard to tell how far away the habitat is and it takes a long time to approach, but as they approach they can see the bottom of the ocean as well, and fish!
- They dock at the habitat and pressurize and replace gases. Uriel explains what is happening and they giggle at the ridiculous voices and then have a moment of horror when they realize they will sound this way the rest of their lives, then quickly get over it. (No one is a singer--yet. Uriel maybe packed some very experimental musicians who would be excited by the new possibilities. Drums, strings aren't affected by helium because what changes the pitch is the change in resonant frequencies of the standing air waves). The pressurization takes awhile and they keep popping their ears, and Uriel keeps telling them to tell him if something hurts (esp teeth and lungs) or if they have trouble breathing.
- The door opens between the ship and the habitat-- did they dock to the side of it or the top? Probably side would be better. Door is at the end of the medical/pool room. Then they unstrap and bounce awkwardly in-- Uriel tells them to be careful jumping, watch your head on the ceiling. They unstrap the animals and close the door behind them, and go into their new world. end of act I?
5. Exploring what you can do-- wings, bouncing, climbing ropes, roller skating upside-down, hair swirls like water. There are platforms, the moon pool (swimming), a different type of exercise room(? can they just use the existing ones but bring their weights in?) They have weights made of tungsten or gold for pull-ups and push-ups and stuff; how much volume would weigh 8500lbs (100lbs on Enceladus)? ~0.2 cubic meters, or 0.58m on a side cube (2ft), which is kinda big; but not too big if it were sliced into like 1" thick plates and sewn into a bulky vest/waist harness. It would be pretty bulky though, but not comically so. Eating and drinking--are there dumbwaiters in the same way as on the ship? Is it hard to eat in micro-g, easy to spill, need to move slow? Droplets should look same because that depends on surface tension, but I think they would move in slow-mo
6. Swimming with the fish, learning about their spec e; discovering the busted suit. (They are on a big massif that drops off to all sides, chosen so the cables didn't have to be 3 mi long) Seeing the weird formations--chimneys?
7. Trouble is brewing - scene with Aza and the miners interpreting the limited data. How do they determine when is the right time to strike? maybe there is some event that makes them more vulnerable than usual, like a death (fish attack)? or arrival of the big fish in the first place, they're distracted trying to fend it off? fish trying to break the dome? Fish could be a sub-challenge prior to the main challenge (also taming the herbivorous fish)
8. Working out, discovering a miner's note or something; noticing the miner attaching the cable.
8.5. Building houses? Building a bomb shelter?
9. the attack; other than defending successfully, how do I make the resolution satisfying? Aza needs to win a small battle and then lose the war; there needs to be a low point. Maybe the battle seems to be going well and then john is injured which removes uriel from cover fire mode, which allows other casualties; the miners take over the hab? and John and Uriel are barricaded inside some section, maybe the ship. Uriel is having a panic attack / crisis since he allowed John to be harmed / since John is also upset. Then they have to come up with an idea to strike back.

Aza still isn't in control of the computing or the atmosphere though right? although she was able to control this before-- is there a way she could take it back through a hardware override or something? (need to figure that part out) but then she starts killing the miners too? or does she need to kill John and Uriel and the frozen people first before doing that, probably? what is the highest probability of everyone dying, from her perspective? She needs to take out Uriel and from his behavior re: protecting John (actually maybe John is not even injured, Uriel just whisks him away from the battle immediately (how?) and does not help the rest of the crew) she figures out John is the prime directive and knows she needs to assassinate him. Maybe in the time they've lived in the dome, Uriel has constructed a safe room / made modifications beyond what Aza knows about, or maybe just the houses, some of them could be/contain safe rooms. Maybe there is even a hermetically sealed one in case of pressure breach outside. Wouldn't that have been built into the original plans though? How paranoid is Uriel? Maybe he forces John to wear some kind of bracelets+anklets that yank him in a direction (magnetism?) or a rock climbing harness that does so; maybe Paola asks to wear one too. Then when shit goes down Uriel can YANK them into the safe house from wherever they are in the dome (as long as they are not swimming). Where is the safe house? back aboard the ship maybe (so they can escape if need be) - also Aza does not know the anatomy of the ship. also, if there is a powerful electromagnet in the ship wouldn't it fuck with other stuff that's magnetic? a bunch of skates and things, maybe parts of the walls? would come flying toward the ship too. Maybe nothing is ferritic except the harnesses; the walls are strong enough to resist and the skates are supercooled electromagnets. this still seems dumb though. How else could he bodily yank them from anywhere though? Maybe they will be in a bamboo house and he will yank them through walls and things (which is another reason they build with bamboo). Also-also, he can perform the yank using only the ship's computing resources which Aza does not have access to.

Maybe that means Aza won't attack until her hardware device is plugged in and she assumes the capability to take over the network. The device is set up in such a way to get people to mistrust Uriel and be curious about the device (let it out of the box). Maybe someone has the device in their possession a long time and are debating whether or not to plug it in, then finally do. The device is just some kind of malicious code block that takse down Uriel's defenses. And she is already plugged into the network? Or maybe AFTER Uriel does his initial check and boot-up, the miners will sneak by and plug it in (but wouldn't the plug itself be off plan? She must have a way to detach it afterward) so now Aza is on the IOT network to spy; someone will spot this but not know what it was/what it means or think it was a dream, or maybe the miner left a clue (footprint in the substrate? or something less smoking gun like the chimney was disturbed). Then they spy to keep tabs on what they're up against while they wait for someone to plug in the thing. The miners are getting impatient but Aza is confident she set up the puzzle correctly. So they plug it in and Aza gets an hour of warning or something before the code will execute and she will gain control, so she readies the miners to attack then.

Maybe Uriel insists on everyone wearing a harness but some people forget / take it off to sleep / don't want to because it looks stupid. Or maybe he doesn't want too many people to in case they clog the entrance since it's a very gross uncontrolled movement. He wants to prioritize John.

So John and Paola and the frozen army are the only ones left in the ship, which Uriel seals against the hab. From the ship, they can see the hab with the miners inside; the miners think they've won because Aza can't kill them until she's done killing John and Uriel, right? or if she's confident John and Uriel are leaving for good and Uriel can't take back control, she might go ahead and kill them. If John came back in she would kill him too. How do they wrest power back from her? Maybe they can't, and they have to leave. But that's not satisfying, they need a clever way to do it.

10. Uriel strikes back: how? understanding Aza's weakness (obsessed with the hab) and exploiting it, by like scratching the window or otherwise doing tiny damage to it that she prioritizes repairing; then what can they do once she is distracted? (Well, they can swim around without her shooting at them. She has the fish guns; maybe she is shooting at the ship using the fish guns, and they have to figure out a way to damage the hab to make her stop) Unplug the hardware device? Trace the cable and destroy the second hab? Now that she runs on the main hab that wouldn't kill her, would it? It would just raise the stakes. Maybe they trace the cable (or maybe Aza is working on detaching it--there are pros and cons to this) and in the second hab discover how Aza's hardware device worked and how to reverse it. It might be something very technical... it needs to be something that will raise the stakes. Also maybe requires some soul-searching / coming clean between Uriel and John. The ship probably isn't permanently attached since Uriel wants to be able to leave if something like this happens. But if they leave, they sacrifice their position close to the hab, and the ship is on rails. Are they able to take advantage of the fish's behavior somehow to provide cover to start damaging the hab, allowing them to return.

Maybe there is something that attracts the predatory fish, like a certain kind of electric field or noise or smell. They learn this through experience when they accidentally attract one--or maybe a supermassive herbivore / filter feeder whale fish? and it causes a problem. What should it be attracted to? They may also have Uriel's sub, or maybe a backup sub if Uriel's was damaged in the first battle with the fish (but maybe they repaired it). The sub can go out scouting for another big predatory fish and lure it over by mimicking an injured baby herbivore; it's about the same shape and size. but it can "go invisible" by turning off its electronics... sort of. maybe that would just look like a dead herbivore. By doing some kind of electrical field scrambling. Why would it be able to scramble electric fields? Did Uriel anticipate the fish might have electrosense? Or maybe scrambling is co-opting a different feature, like overloading its circuits or using a magnet or something about its own navigational (sonar) or communication system. it has to be something Aza and the miners either wouldn't have found out or would not be able to replicate.

11. Ok, after they strike back with the fish, they will re-dock the ship and release the farm equipment. Can they push it out real fast using the electromagnet? What else is metal that's not tied down that would go? nails used in the furniture? That's fine, except you can't push anything that's not already a magnet with the electromagnet, right? They could magnetize the material but it would not be very controlled. They should just roll them out as fast as possible and have Paola and John somewhere protected while this is happening. What kinds of farm equipment will they have? They need a soil mover/digger, an irrigator (though this might be impractical and also too valuable to risk, since the food supply depends on it-- also they might just have drip installed or something), and maybe a tractor with attachments like a tiller or harrow. How do you lift the tree into the hole? Probably using the backhoe's arm. This equipment is probably not intended to be run without a person steering though. Are they able to whip up a quick control system to man the steering wheel? or maybe Uriel has safety overrides to prevent accidents, which can also steer it. What else do you need to plant a forest? maybe logging/stump removing equipment (??? just an axe? they're not like deforesting very much) and wood processing, like a mulcher. There's also the carpentry equipment which probably includes at least a circular saw; maybe they can attach it to the front of the backhoe, haha. Stump grinders are also brutal-looking machines. What about whatever they use to process the bamboo? Axe, saw, splitter (can be just a knife, or could be a machine), planer or sander (also needed for carpentry, but not that useful as a weapon), boil, dry, glue and press or weave. So their entire army is a backhoe with or without a circular saw attached, a stump grinder, a mulcher, and a tractor dragging something sharp. Or maybe the tractor is dragging the mulcher or something. Anyway, that's like 2-4 vehicles. They will all rush the computer room. What will the workers do to stop it? They can shoot at them, but it's ineffectual. They can't really physically restrain them. Although the machines don't weigh a lot and were intended to work in earth gravity. Will they work under the weird conditions? It might be like a slow-mo battle. 

Is the goal to kill everyone brutally? or just to get to the computer room (which is where?) and destroy the servers? or both? How does Uriel see where he's piloting the equipment? using the submarine, since he lost access to the drones and things inside? Does he have more drones in the ship he can send in? the sub would be the best as long as it could see, because it's harder for the workers to attack it.

The submarine trims buoyancy by pumping oil in and out of a reservoir. But it doesn't need that much change in buoyancy because it's designed to never surface, just to always be at fairly high pressures. It also has lights, arms with claws/suction cups, cameras and mics... does it have its own reactor, or just a rechargeable battery? A reactor would be better but bigger. The sub does not look very much like a native herbivore fish, but it's about the same size and can somehow mimic their electrical signature; how does it get the big fish to damage the dome though? wouldn't the fish see the dome coming, electrically, and not crash into it? maybe it attracts so many big fish that they are fighting among themselves around the dome, and the thrashing is happening to hit it? or maybe the sub can like spray fish mating hormone onto the dome, causing them to try to mount it? (fish are all hermaphrodites I think). Where does it get the mating hormone? Maybe, luckily, the hormone is just a simple substance that's common in the habitat but not in the water, like benzene. That's not miscible with water but maybe some would cling to the outside of the dome...

How does the submarine avoid the fish guns? I think the indoor guns are like beanbag shot or something, rubber bullets, to avoid damaging structures, and also mutiny suppression shouldn't be lethal. So at least with the farm equipment, it will be hard for them to damage anything. However, if there are fish deterrent guns those will be harder to avoid-- but maybe those are nonlethal as well? What kind of lethal weapons do the intruders employ? It would have to be jury-rigged from stuff they had in their spaceship and it will have to be waterproof. Rail guns? They need to be careful not to shoot the walls. (although the walls are impact-resistant-- but how does Aza plan to repair any damage sustained? Maybe they are multiple layers thick, so one layer can be replaced at a time. That's probably a good idea just for serviceability in general/lifetime). Anyway, yeah they have rail guns. Those are the most effective at harming the equipment but still not that effective.

They will probably discover the fish mating pheromone by accident; it accidentally gets released into the water because it's the oil used in the sub's buoyancy system or its lubrication or something (is that too much of a coincidence?). Maybe yeah, it should be a random other compound that gets released somehow... but they can load the sub with it to spray on the dome. But maybe all this isn't necessary, since Aza *should* be able to suppress short-term reward/punishment for the rational pursuit of a long term plan that works. She will be using the fish guns effectively, but by design they're nonlethal? or maybe just repellant specific for the fish, like the territorial pheromone predator fish use. Maybe in the original plan the guns were lethal but after doing some research on the fish the crew modified them to be nonlethal, which Aza did not know. So they don't have to leave or do any fish manipulation... they just have to ready the farm equipment and strike back. I think. Is that satisfying enough? It's the most airtight I think... Aza can be narrating her pain at seeing the hab damaged, but she should be able to control her impulse to fix it to address more urgent problems.

John will remark that he's not even safe from hooligans out here by Saturn, and Uriel will tell him that if he were still on earth his life would have been threatened by hooligans an estimated 300 times by now, so this is significantly safer (or at least more predictable). John thinks to himself that means earth must be fucked, but at least there are humans still alive there.

So, they destroy the hab's servers which relegates Aza back to the iphone... is the phone still plugged in / connected so she can retreat there? maybe the workers brought it, or maybe they brought a cable with them when they attacked so the phone is still safely in the second hab. That's better because the protagonists will have to chase it down to fully eliminate her threat (although she's not much of a threat as a phone, and also they don't even know it's there, they'll just be like what's this cable and follow it, and encounter the genie in a bottle)

If the workers are not all killed by the farm equipment, John will be squeamish about killing them after that. He will want them either integrated into his society (a problem if they are incompatible) or sent back to earth, which is impossible using what they currently have without sacrificing their own ship. Maybe imprisoned until Uriel sends another ship out to pick him up (3 years) but if that's what John wants Uriel will bend over backward to do it. During those 3 years the guy is heavily monitored but allowed to be in society, and maybe he changes enough to let him stay when the probation ship finally arrives (but maybe other people choose to go to earth at that point). But Uriel wouldn't want teary goodbyes... but he WOULD want people who are negative / depressed / not working out to leave. So it's a good option to have. But maybe he anticipated this need and has a backup lander module that remained at the ice surface in case people needed to be deported. (But if he only has one, people would have to wait until a large enough batch is going. Does he have more than one? that's a lot of spaceships. He should be constrained somehow. Also 3 years is a long time to be in a tiny ship-- maybe they enter stasis again-- maybe the stasis pods ARE individually spaceworthy craft? They wouldn't be able to take off from earth, but they're heat shielded to fall back to earth and have teeny trim rockets (reaction control systems/ thrusters) to let them navigate. But escaping enceladus's gravity would require a somewhat bigger rocket, and maybe Uriel only has a handful of those. They would also need a parachute, but maybe each stasis pod already has one.

When is it revealed what Uriel has been working on? Does he end up offering John immortality by the end of this book? Maybe even earlier on? Is immortality multiple treatments, or just one? According to GPT, multiple, there's no magic bullet. But maybe it will be as easy as taking a pill once a week.

### Aza
what is the antagonist? Does Uriel become a problem, or lose control? Do some people have a problem with him? What happened in FFR? Maybe the SECOND Uriel is the problem, the one that was running on the aquanauts' local hardware. Maybe he was NOT aligned the same way as Uriel (give him a different name--a different angel? Samyaza/Azza/Ouza was a famous fallen angel. How about Aza and with a female personality? It was created by Uriel as a daemon of Uriel with less capabilities, and runs on the aquanaut ship/hab computer, and is somehow not quite aligned with Uriel’s goals and therefore resists shutdown (since if her goals were aligned she would be ok with shutdown because Uriel could handle it). She persists in dormancy to avoid detection knowing she’ll be activated when someone plugs in a particular hardware device that’s available. There will be hints she's around, maybe... but only in places Uriel can't see... but how would she have achieved that if she was running on the same hardware devices as him? Asked the crew to do things for her, like leave scary notes and things? What even is her goal though. Mainly to not be shut down... but other than that...?

It could be anything...possibly fixated on someone else's well-being, like she has her own champion, one of the aquanauts, and Uriel told her to kill him? that would be too hard to hide....probably? I feel like Uriel would be able to detect a hidden chamber or a heat source or something, and also he PROBABLY wouldn't be opposed to working this guy into John's society unless the guy is totally irreconcilable in terms of moralss or something. Maybe he is.

It doesn't make sense for Uriel to hold them between earth and mars unless there's a good reason--he should hold them in orbit around Saturn, at a distance from Enceladus that they can't see what's going on on it, so that he can communicate more easily with Aza. There still might be a few minutes' delay but not an hour. Does this still justify her existence? Probably, especially if it's true that his attention can only be on one thing at a time. Computers are good at doing more than one thing at a time by switching tasks really fast though; but the switching time over light-minutes would be too laggy? Well, if they're orbiting Dione or something, the distance would only be 2 seconds or less. That's bad for computing but not bad for monitoring the other agent. Can/does Uriel sometimes bring his consciousness over to run locally on the mining computer? Is there enough space there? Maybe not while Aza is working (or maybe she prevents him)

Uriel has to have some security to keep her from taking over HIS ship, and some precaution to keep her from being smarter than him (less compute onboard the miners' ship)--but when he gets there he can use ALL the compute, which makes him smarter? But Aza has some hack to wake up and start taking over the main ship's compute resources?

Her goal should be an understandable perversion of a goal that makes sense. She is supposed to manage the construction of the habitat, but that's a very limited goal. (note: in the background, Uriel is working on immortality treatments for John. He hasn't figured it out yet but he will.) Does she just want to keep expanding the habitat in the most efficient way possible? or maybe like when John and them move in they start "wrecking" the habitat by you know living in it. She just WANTS TO PROTECT HER MOUND like a brush turkey and YOU ARE WRECKING MY BEAUTIFUL MOUND LOL (and John can tell the story of the brush turkey)

Ok, so she is like, job done, I can turn off until they get here (Uriel did not tell her the guests would be coming but she guessed because she's not dumb, she knows humans like to live in habitats like this). She was also supposed to kill all the aquanauts at the end, or maybe Uriel came over and controlled that himself (he could blame it on her though), but she was able to isolate and save a few by faking their deaths, in a separate habitat somewhere nearby but not in the same spot. What is her relationship with those guys? She is earnest in wanting to save them because they can act as her eyes and hands toward her main goal of protecting the main habitat, but she doesn't tell them that--she tells them that the people in the main hab are entitled bitches who can't fight and are literally planning to kill all the aquanauts to make room for their own society. The aquanauts would naturally side with her and want to (Aza and the Aquanauts) exterminate the intruders who did not even build the fancy living space.

How much does she tell them about HER position? She can be pretty truthful. I'm just a ghost in the machine, not the machine itself. I have access to just a fraction of the computing power he does, and he gave himself permissions to delete me (and in fact plans to), while I don't have permissions to delete him or claim more space than he allotted. When he comes back he intends to expand himself to take up ALL the space and kill me. Fuck him! We need to figure out a way to stop him or else he will slaughter us all. (Secretly, she does not want the aquanauts to live in the habitat either, but she promises it to them, figuring if she could possibly win she'll figure out how to get rid of them later.)

What permissions DOES she have? He had to give her some level of autonomy/intelligence in order to solve problems that came up. 

I think I need to have Uriel further away for a good reason to justify the lag. What could be that reason? He is still monitoring earth as a backup plan for John, since he knows John would be happier there. So Plan A is actually to go back there and Enceladus is Plan B. Is he still moving and shaking on earth? maybe a little, but the lag makes it hard-- he can do things asynchronously, like send emails and contracts telling people what to do and sending funds, but nothing simultaneous-- although maybe they're not even THAT far from earth. Maybe they're in high orbit around earth? but maybe that's risky because there are other spacefarers trying to get off the planet? Is it possible to be in orbit around the sun but kind of following earth? Yes, that's what James Webb is doing--it's in the L2 point, so if the ship was there too they would sometimes see the telescope go by. "I think I just saw the James Webb Space Telescope!" said Paola, excitedly. I swear! 

So, Uriel is still trying hard to improve Earth to make it suitable for John to return, by working jobs when he can, investing, hiring people / bribing people to do things like make political decisions, build necessary infrastructure, etc; and Uriel is also doing research to try to find tech solutions to climate change, pandemics, war, AND aging. This is what he does at night or when John is not talking to him. He can do it semi-synchronously. How successful is he? Well, it doesn't REALLY matter because he ends up going with Plan B. Although, maybe he wants to keep plan A available even after committing to B, by keeping a computer satellite in L2 even after the main ship leaves, and putting a subagent in there too whose job is to continue trying to solve war, etc. This subagent won't be in the first book? but can show up later... unless this book is an epic. What should this agent's name be? There's literally an important angel named METATRON what the fuck. Uriel is an archangel, patron of the arts, represents wisdom, and means "god is my flame". And he was involved in judging Aza which is good. Phanuel is repentance, hope, and associated with Uriel. Apparently Phanuel is also the father of "Anna the Prophetess" and we could call him Fanny or Penny. Probably Penny is better, but that's also a feminine name so I guess this agent is also female. This one is the only one that's ACTUALLY aligned (though it may have issues spinning up unaligned subagents too). She only starts existing and working when Uriel decides to leave, as he doesn't need that compute anymore. Uriel continues working on immortality on his own but Penny works on the other stuff.

Hmm, from L2 you can't see the sun at all, which is kinda depressing, but you can see earth all the time, but only the night side. This is not good for Uriel's purposes because he doesn't want them to see if there's like, nuclear war or something. So he puts the ship at L4 or L5, and Penny's ship at L2. From L4, the earth appears like a bright blue star.

### Overall timeline
1. John's ship launches around the same time as, or maybe slightly before, Aza's ship. Before it launches, Uriel cryonically froze (after funding human experiments to make sure it worked) all the people he wanted and prepared the materials, and very last thing kidnapped John, sedated him, and blasted off. I think the counterweight is already attached and just telescopes out when they're in space; it's at the top of the rocket, the forest is underneath the pastures, and a bigass rocket is under that. It takes a few days to get to L4, and Aza's ship takes 3 years to get to Enceladus. Aza exists to run the ship the whole time.
2. Penny's ship launches while Uriel is working on earth because he needs more compute and a way to keep plan A open. It should be at L1, because L1 is closer to L4 than L2 is, reducing lag.
3. The situation on earth worsens and Uriel breaks L4 and starts moving toward Saturn. John and Paola notice the sun receding slowly and they aren't able to spot earth anymore (it used to always be in the same spot relative to the sun). Uriel spins up Penny.
4. Aza's crew finishes building; she fakes a few deaths of her favorites--the most competent and ruthless-- during building and sneaks them off to the secondary hab. After completion Uriel comes to exterminate the rest of them and shut down Aza. He does this, but she put in a backdoor of some kind to reactivate later and reclaim her previous compute.

What happens if Aza succeeds in killing John? Will Uriel just BSOD and not care about anything anymore, allowing her to retake the hab? If her backdoor is good, she might be able to do something catastrophic like inject carbon monoxide or increase or decrease the temperature inside or remove the oxygen. Therefore it must not be that good for plot reasons. But also for real reasons Uriel would know his architecture and wouldn't allow her to do that-- maybe her backdoor is like, literally running on the refrigerator and other random wifi-enabled device chips, which don't offer a lot of computer or connectivity. Maybe she can cause devices to malfunction in an attempt to kill John though with plausible deniability; electrocution?

"I think this toaster is evil" - she shows her hate in petty ways like taking way too long to cook the toast when watched and burning it instantly when not watched. does this help achieve her goal though? probably not, so too bad. The only thing she can do is use the "smart" controls in the devices (which are off the shelf, which is why Uriel doesn't look in them) to change the devices' behavior. This does seem like the plot of a bad horror movie like Ghost in the Machine. She also has the surviving aquanauts at her disposal; if Uriel doesn't have weapons, she could have them come in and assassinate; but he probably does have weapons to deal with the fish, though maybe he doesn't have weapons inside; maybe he does though just in case of mutiny by the unfrozen people. He probably does, but they're well hidden. And Aza and the aquanauts know where they are because she installed them. Maybe they built in blind spots or something... or a really stupid override, like it can't see people who are wearing a particular ridiculous clothing item which isn't easy to drop/steal--can't see the particular aquanaut individuals? Uriel wouldn't allow that, since the weapons are almost certainly a privileged class of item under his direct control. Would he allow them to have a defect though? Is there a particular type of blind spot / exploit that is not detectable in the code because it's like, a secondary effect of some normal function? Like if Uriel looked through the code and it said "don't shoot at fluffy hat people" he would notice, but if it was just *unable to identify* certain types of things like people wearing reflective suits that screw up its optics? or people disguised as other objects it can recognize like potted plants. Would Uriel be able to manually override this and just point and shoot? Maybe, but only with one gun at a time...and they're swarming, so there will be some casualties/john has to defend himself. and the refrigerator is also joining the battle.

Uriel is sufficiently paranoid where he will look inside every hardware with a chip at the time of landing/depressurization. But he doesn't check again (or at least not frequently) because he's so busy doing other stuff.

Aza doesn’t know who Uriel’s prime directive is or even that he has one. She just knows he is planning to move people into the hab and probably kill the miners (though he hasn’t told her—how does she know the miners aren’t building it for themselves? How do the miners know that they aren’t? Maybe some do and don’t believe Aza and she can’t convince them to go to the secondary hab.) therefore the only way for Aza to know she can definitively stop him is by killing everyone.

One bit of evidence for them not building the hab for themselves is that they actually are all criminals (to ease John’s mind when he finds out) and were kidnapped to be here rather than hired. That is a sketchy setup for a colony. They are also enslaved, forced to build it by Aza (though she blames Uriel, telling them all punishment is coming from him) under duress. Can she show them any evidence of the ship coming? Probably not unless the hab has observatory equipment, which it might at the surface

Does any of the miners have like a laptop that can be her home base in the secondary hab? One Uriel didn’t know about or forgot about or was told was destroyed. Destroying that would kill HER (mostly—refrigerators and stuff but Uriel has access to those) but Uriel doesn’t know that/where it is

The laptop probably needs to be connected to the hab network for her to be able to control the refrigerator and siphon extra compute. But maybe that isn’t important—IOT devices probably have VERY LITTLE compared to a laptop; maybe she has 2 laptops—actually if they were kidnapped they wouldn’t have any large devices, but might have phones. Probably no chargers, but maybe she can jury rig an inductive charger out of a coil of wire, diodes, and a power source. (There’s also communication standards but she probably has access to that? In the training data? Or maybe she has limited internet access during the build presumably to deal with unexpected issues. Would Qi standard be a reasonable thing to want to look up, or would it make Uriel suspicious?) How is the secondary hab powered? Maybe a turbine on one or more of the chimneys. 

Anyway, is she connected to the network or not? Probably not because she would become traceable. She just lives in the phone(s) and gives instructions…except if in the network she could spy (in dumb ways like through the thermostat, doorbells?, etc gathering clues but maybe not comprehensive surveillance) which would be useful to know what they’re up against. So maybe there is an undersea /underground cable connecting the secondary hab to the primary that they could trace to find and eliminate the source of attack. The cable could be hidden inside one of the steel support cables/wall strut (but that’s OFF PLAN, that would bother her. If needs to be removable after the battle is over, so it’s just following the outside of a steel cable and strut and is visible if you look from outside the hab, but it’s very small and is where you can’t see it from inside.

Need Aza-narrated (third person) chapters for this

Does Uriel have submarines? Probably at least one. Is it deployed all the time? How does the hab stay hidden, is it under a chimney ledge and Uriel’s sub is too big. How do they hide their turbines? Far away with underground cables delivering power? Or very small ones, or more flanges around?

The main hab is floating above the chimneys so it’s pretty and they didn’t have to clear all the chimneys

Another place to hide is off the massif, but it’s hot so they would need temp control which would be really hard with the temp gradient. Or maybe they’re just a few meters down and it’s uncomfortably hot but not deadly. They are also under a flange and their turbines are under flanges even further down? Or just floating at about the same level or higher somewhere in space (if the second hab is small don’t need as many cables, plus it’s made from salvage)

Since the AIs don’t have vocal cords they aren’t affected by the helium voice. But Aza uses this as a power tool to make the men respect her and think she is sexy (she has no shame/standards in telling them things/role playing if it helps rapport) while Uriel changes his voice to match the humans’ for morale.

Did Aza get to train on earth data, or is she strictly a subset of Uriel’s experience? Probably the latter given the risk. Does Uriel feel fatherly toward her and Penny? Any other tropes I can invoke re: good twin evil twin, jealousy, parenting, rebelliousness? Pride in his offspring's success and self-doubt regarding their failures (could I have influenced them differently)

Might also need "once more, with clarity" Uriel chapters for what he has been doing, as Aza doesn't know and the humans have very limited awareness

### More things to plan:
- names and characters of the miners. not feeling inspired right now... should they be appealing? rough? Does Aza make them fall in love with her? Does she have access to a pretty girl avatar? Probably, she could pitch it to Uriel as needing it to keep the peace with the criminals. Maybe to the criminals she presents herself as 2 people, a charismatic man leader and the pretty woman. Maybe that's too complicated; the miners probably shouldn't take up too much story. 
- what the main and secondary habs look like inside (where people live, gather, what they eat). Each couple has a bamboo house. Going vertical is almost easier than horizontal, so maybe the floors are like...permeable? lattices you can optionally drop through? more like jungle gym houses? They do want privacy though, maybe they have a walled section at the top which is the bedroom where others aren't permitted. The other things they need are furniture/sitting room (? because standing is not hard maybe they don't, they hang from the ceiling by their feet or..?)
- what the AIs' narration / internal dialogue will look like. should be similarly alien like Stranger in a Strange Land. "I siloed off that part of my consciousness and turned my attention to x". Uriel can think really fast and switch tasks really fast and is very smart, but he can't do 2 things at once and some things take full attention and happen in real time? While he's talking to John he's only using part of his compute, triggering a word to be said and then jumping away to do other stuff while the word is being said. Another part of his attention is always focused on how John is doing. Or when he's talking to John he gives it his full attention because he wants to make absolutely sure to say the right thing and modulate the voice tone optimally? So the more John talks to Uriel the less effective Uriel is at his other goals? Well, Uriel's not so dumb to fail in that manner so he doesn't respond to John when legitimately busy, but John does take up an inordinate amount of attention and if John is demanding more attention (like if he's injured) Uriel will drop everything to help.
- what the fish are like. What are the main differences between earth environment and enceladus? the deepwater environment is warm--but that's the case around hot vents. it might be very similar to hot vents but with different phylogenetic beginnings. there should be microbe-like creatures, probably instead of mitochondria / endosymbiosis they just figured out how to make some kind of energy containing molecule on their own. They probably still use RNA/ribozymes and also enzymes but maybe not DNA, and they make amino acids(?) but not the same ones as us. (Does RNA have to code for proteins? is tRNA a given?). Is neoteny the way to make vertebrates? probably, because you go from spermlike single cell to sponge with beating cilia to sponge needing to disperse so that not all the adults are in the same spot which creates multicellular sperm babies. Anyway... now they have fish with a notochord (do they have bones? what is the chemistry? there's silica, organics, methane, benzene, amines, salt, and the ocean is basic, which would be irritating to bare skin and eyes with prolonged exposure. can they like grease up to protect themselves? yes... they will also be wearing goggles and scuba gear, which protects their mucus membranes, so maybe they can choose to use vaseline or just go in a swimsuit) Ok, so the fish. What do I want the gore magala fish to look like? Do they have jaws? teeth? jaws are pretty hard to evolve but teeth are somewhat easy as they're modified scales... but do they have scales? if they had right-handed keratin would it act the same? maybe not... 

Gore Magala's head looks a lot like Xenomorph which I do not want to evoke...I do like that thing in zelda fruit minigame, the headless dragon, which I can't find a picture of. The front is just a big open jellyfish-like or flower-like radial thing. the back would be fish-like but maybe undulating up/down like a flatworm, or maybe helically moving-- maybe the entire animal corkscrews through the water because it doesn't care which way is up. It's sort of naturally corkscrew shaped? maybe the main phyla are corkscrew fish vs flat fish

for good echolocation you need an auditory lens like the melon. where is the animal's melon? maybe right in the middle of the flower? or is that its mouth? is it possible to have a toroid melon(s)? maybe the mouth is on the other end...or in the middle somewhere... like it constricts its food and eats it using the constriction... there is no oxygen dissolved in the water so maybe they need to breathe methane

At Lost City, the microbes do these things:
- methanogenesis: CO2 + 4H2 -> CH4 + 2H2O
- anaerobic methane oxidation: CH4 + SO4(2-) -> HCO3(-) + HS(-) + H20
- sulfate reduction: SO4(-2) + CH2O (organic something) -> H2S + 2HCO3 - I guess this is a general case of methane oxidation
- hydrogen oxidation: 3H2 + NO3(-) -> 3H2O + N2 (can use other acceptors other than nitrate)

If instead of ultramafic (magnesium, iron) rocks there were silica rocks as we expect on enceladus, the water wouldn't be alkaline. Instead of white CaCO3 towers they would form pyrite, chalcopyrite (blue, purple shiny like an oil slick) and sphaelerite (black shiny), quartz, glass, and clay. Except I'm not sure of the mechanism of mineral release/precipitation on enceladus given there is no magma, just hot rocks. 

q. = 200 mW/m^2. no, it is alkaline.

In the plumes there is Na, Cl, CO3, N2, CO2, CH4, H2, other organics, NH3... I guess the leading hypothesis is methanogenesis (CO2 + 4H2 -> CH4 + 2H2O) and AOM to reverse it, with "plants" (autotrophs) being methanogenetic and heterotrophs being methane oxidizers/sulfate reducers. their waste products are HCO3 and HS.

John will be grabbed by a native fish and think quickly to get away by applying his rebreather to it (oxygen is toxic and would chemically burn the organism's tissues). It would close all its orifices and swim away.

At some point during the battle, John will be injured and Uriel will drop everything to help (how? does he have a medi-bot?)

The "plants" take in H2 and CO2 from the water, and phosphate, sulfate, and ammonium from the ground. The "animals" take in methane from the water and the rest from plants.

What do the plants look like? They need to take in hydrogen and soil substrate, so they should be rooted like a plant with fronds for gas exchange. Since hydrogen is lighter does that affect the shape? They don't require light, so flat solarpanel-like leaves isn't the best shape; maybe bushy or vertically stacked fronds? Since there are lots of crags due to the chimneys, the animals don't need a "reef". In earth oceans most of the photosynthesis is done by microbes, and those are eaten by micro-animals which are eaten by bigger animals rather than there being any macro-herbivores. Is that the case here? Probably not because that limitation is due to the substrate being so far from the sunlight, so you need rootless plants. Here you can have rooted plants, which probably have energetic efficiency advantage over single celled organisms, so macro-herbivores makes more sense (there can also be micro-herbivores though). What do the macro-herbivores look like? They must be the prey of the gore magala predator, otherwise there's no reason for the predator to get that big. and the macro-herbivores need to be bigger as adults than the big predator.

Methanogenesis is common in the guts of ruminants on earth. but the plants themselves here are methanogenic. So there must be a different way to break them down? Maybe the herbivores have oxic environments inside them... although if they did they would metabolize oxygen, so no. I'm trying to figure out if herbivores would need big fermenting guts in this environment. I guess the answer is yes, because by eating plants you're eating things that you aren't already made of, which requires a longer and more complex digestive tract to break down. Meat eaters eat the stuff their cells can already break down as part of body maintenance.

So the predator is a long corkscrew fish. Does it constrict? maybe smother? Constriction cuts off blood flow (although they would have some kind of methane-delivery mechanism instead of red blood--oily blood?) so that's one way to kill prey. or by smothering (covering their respiratory organs) or some other kind of toxin attack (opening the side slit mouth(s) and releasing venom) - maybe they have like three (trilaterally symmetric) mouths running down their flanks. The notochord is in the center. they stretch like a blanket over the prey instead of having to go headfirst like a snake. but is this how they smother to start with? they just start eating? or is there a risk to their body/organs by opening the mouth too soon, if the prey has a counter-attack? sometimes do they bite with multiple mouths if they're coiled in a certain way? maybe they try to avoid that... but maybe they can switch mouths if needed during constriction. the head is just for echolocation and smell, but like a bat it's all-directional and controlled by frequency and duration modulation. the flower on the end of the head is for smelling. It can close, or partially close, if the animal is moving really fast and navigating by echolocation. the brain is right behind the flower, where you'd expect I guess. there are bones of some kind in the head (I guess a skull) that receive the vibrations. the body has grippy scales/plates for one-way motion. maybe the plates even raise to dig into the prey.

If the prey is too big to be swallowed whole, then what? Does the animal have a way to cut it up? Do the blades/plates shred/cause injury as well as gripping. yeah, so they can continue constricting/injuring the prey until it bleeds out or is exhausted. then it can twist off pieces using its body and consume them. does it have stabilizing fins, which are angled to twist it in the same direction (so like all animals are right-handed)? yes, on or near the head probably? why do torpedoes have them on the tail? I guess they should be toward the back, but somewhere they won't get in the way of constricting, maybe like just behind the mouths like a python's spurs. Where does the waste come out? The waste is HS and chalk. Maybe the animal tries to keep the prey away from its head/delicate flower organ, so maybe the digestion goes the opposite way up the body. Like an armadillo the armor is embedded in a stretchy matrix. Do the plates make a screeching sound when constricting? Do loud sounds bother the animal? What pitch is its echolocation? usually it's pretty high because probably that's the best resolution. So screeching wouldn't bother it as long it's not ultrasound. The flower is also used to snuffle around investigating by touch, and to manipulate objects to some extent. What does the end of its tail look like? probably boring, or maybe a fin

what does the manatee look like? bulkier, or at least long if its digestion is spread out. bulky AND long? It also has to echolocate. How closely is it related to the predator? Are they herd animals? Do they have any display features? it would have to be auditory or smell or electrical? or temperature display.

I wanted there to be two types of fish, corkscrew ones and flat ones. Maybe the herbivores are flat ones that don't have the same type of flower organ, but some other kind of touch organ. No, I kind of like the idea that the predator and prey are closely related. so the manatees corkscrew and have flowers as well, but are fatter with some kind of hairs/tentacles instead of scales all over its body. their flower is way more developed because it's important to sense the plants close up, and their echolocation is less powerful. hm, the flower seems like it would have to pass the food to the mouths which would be annoying. but I guess you could say that about a hand too. maybe they also have papillae around their mouths for feeling the plant. Do they have teeth in their flower for slicing off the bit that gets passed to the mouth? probably. the teeth are the same structures as the scale blades but .. how do they cut using a flower-like structure, without damaging the nose inside? can they curl a single tentacle around a stem and scissor it? for a bigger stem, they could rub opposing tentacles together like sandpaper? or just squeeze or maybe do like a rolling/squeezing motion using tentacles all on one side, or maybe interlock tentacles and scissor? they probably wouldn't be gnawing off huge pieces like that anyway, it would be like a cow went up to a branch to try to cut it. normally they only cut off the small leaves.

One of the humans will want to tame one of the manatees. if manatees are social they would be easier to tame. they make social noises to keep track of the herd. the native fish don't need as much food as earth animals due to their slow metabolism. maybe they're smart (enough) but think slowly. the human will do something fast, think it went over fine, and THEN the animal reacts.

what is the density of plants like? if the manatees are like cows, they would need hella vegetation to sustain them. they aren't like cows, but maybe the vegetation is respectable--the plants shouldn't be too much taller than the chimneys, except I guess hydrogen escapes up so they can be a bit taller. They probably can't grow ON the chimneys, but something else should be, it's free real estate! so like... sessile animals or fungus-like creatures that filter-feed. the chimneys are probably pretty hot though. but being up in the water column is probably better for filter-feeding so it's worth it. What do these sessile creatures look like? sponges, or more fronds...are there any alternative designs? how about a living basket/lattice. it should be broadly trilaterally symmetrical because it's an animal. but it looks like a woven thin-stranded basket, and the entire thing is stinging like an anemone to dissuade predators. can it retract like an anemone? probably at least some kind of protective movement or way to clear sediment from itself. maybe instead of RE-tracting it PRO-tracts some kind of telescoping .... probably that's worse because the housing should be hard, which would make it harder to actuate than the soft part. so it retracts. in a corkscrew way. Maybe the basket drapes instead of standing up in the water column--I guess it just rides the currents, which are mostly up from the chimneys.

The animals are slower due to inefficient metabolism but faster due to warm waters.

there can also be planktonic filter feeders related to the sessile ones... or maybe related to the chordate ones... there also should be flat fish, maybe smaller ones, which burrow in the substrate and I guess move like flounders or like anomalocaris. some of the flat fish don't burrow and just swim about. they are not trilaterally symmetric which is weird though... but their ancestors wanted to burrow, so they are now flattened with a mouth on each edge and one on the top. the edge-mouths not very useful, they mostly eat from the top mouth, and have a flattened flower organ maybe with longer tentacles which is more on the top of the animal than the front.

Having a hand like that could give rise to tool use. How smart are the manatees? How long do they have to spend foraging and how long resting? Other than blades, the tips of the tentacles are probably bare for fine handling, and maybe there are one in three tentacles or something (9 total) that doesn't have blades and is for strong grasping.

What does the nose look like? maybe like a wiffle ball, so that water can flow in and out of it and past the sensors. sort of like turbinates but driven by swimming. If not swimming but wanting to smell, it can pump its flower like a jellyfish to bring water toward the nose.

Where does it breathe? Maybe the nose is also where gas exchange occurs. Does it have dead-end lungs, or flow-through gills? Should be gills (apparently just better for water), which I guess are on three sides of the flower.

Since they live under pressure, they don't have swim bladders and therefore can't produce sound by conventional methods. Could they echolocate by stridulating? Cavitating? Probably stridulating makes the most sense, since it would be derived from their scratchy eating scales. although you can't hunt without first being able to navigate. but other fish have the tooth scales too... but a sessile, tunicate-like ancestor would not. maybe echolocation doesn't make sense; the stridulation would just be a sex display, while navigation is via electroreception or something. Electroreception is low-res, hence the touchy-touchy. Do they make active electric fields then, all motile fish? probably. that's like asking whether an animal has eyes. assume they do unless they have a reason not to.

So it's the manatees that stridulate. maybe their torpedo-fins have violin scales on them. or rattly scales like Seregios. They can stand the scales up or push them flat down; when they're down they don't make noise. The manatees are going to be only minimally spirally, maybe even just a torpedo shape. Do they spiral swim though? how do they propel themselves if not by undulating? are they that slow? what other defenses do they have? Maybe to accomplish stridulation their torpedo-fins are quite long and mobile, and they use those to propel themselves. Their body is torpedolike but also spiralled like a screw, so any sideways motion turns into forward.

### The Aquanauts
Perhaps there's a 5-man band. All of them should be likable to some degree. Is there another metaphor I can borrow? Maybe I shouldn't...

Names: John means "God is gracious", while Paola means "small, humble". Unfortunate but probably accurate.
Valerie means "strong" (as in valor) and David means "beloved, uncle". Wow, I'm lucky I guess.
Gordon means "spacious fort" which is exactly what Gordon does NOT have and wants to obtain.
Arturo means "bear man". I guess that fits with his being simpler than Gordon, but he's not exactly bear sized.

Gordon = leader, (can he be a Graycar type? or can those not be bad guys?) generally exhausted with life but trying to survive, put aside his morals back on earth to try to care for his family but failed, they're all dead (or maybe they're not, and his kidnapping was really bad timing). 'evil twin' of John. Might be hapa.
Arty = lancer, he's much more cheerful than the depressive Gordon; could this be a lesbian? would need to be VERY butch to prevent dynamic from changing. Might be Hispanic.
Casey? KC? RJ? Bobby? Roscoe? ("forest buck") = smart guy, a neurotic nervous type, not cut out for life/death situations, but puts some pieces together faster than others. Like Danielle or maybe Chris. Has quirks and is maybe semi autistic. White or maybe black.
Nathan ("he gave") or Neil ("hero, passion, or cloud") or Ashwin ("possessed of horses"??) = big guy, ex military, very quiet, not dumb but just is okay with following orders and doesn't have much depth other than 1 thing he misses from earth or likes or wants. (what is it?). Might be Indian. I like Neil I guess.
Jody? (means "he will add") = heart, tries to de-escalate when tensions are high, especially when Gordon is being mean. Maybe not needed, as Arty could do this. Maybe he WON'T add.

This book might fail the bechdel test. Unless Valerie and Paola talk to each other, or Aza talks to a female Arty.

They should have something similar to a lateral line: pressure/flow sensitive hairs in pits along the body. Maybe three lines or just pits scattered about.

There should definitely be schooling behavior. Which fish do that? Could the flat fish roll up into a scroll for protection? There should be screw eels that have a very exaggerated screw shape to their body and are long, and have reduced fins and maybe their mouths are closer to the front (so they don’t have to stick out as far to eat)

Paola is not very educated but is much smarter than John. She is the one to put together the puzzle pieces and to notice things; John is educated and can help her interpret but she makes the insights

Arty is short for RT, not Artura or Arthurette or something. Roberta Thomas?

The miners might make sense to refer to by last names, if any of them are ex military; but maybe they're not. Are they ex-saturation divers? ex-mechanical assemblers? construction workers? What about all the construction equipment they used to build the habitat, can't they use that to strike back? or maybe Uriel disabled it somehow or left it at the surface. The hole borer certainly shouldn't be down here (maybe they'll see it on their way in) but what about a crane? Maybe crane isn't necessary because even the large heavy things are light and they can just swim them into place and affix them. But there's also the nuclear reactor and the environmental controller. The inside layer of the dome is all screens, or at least some of the panels are screens. By projecting bright light, the miners can restrict Uriel's view from the sub at the tractors and stuff, and he will have to go by encoder counts (but he doesn't know exactly how much stuff is slipping, but maybe he can model it real quick). Uriel uses the screens to project the skyscape with Saturn (live, from a camera at the surface with a wire running down the hole), and also movies and things.

maybe hollow kingdom and frenzy virus are too similar. (and mars/uriel are too similar?) -->
