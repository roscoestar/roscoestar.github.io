Well, winter's almost over, and I haven't yet made my seasonal art post!  So without further ado, here's what I've been drawing lately.

I wasn't really satisfied with how the first two "Land Before Time But Accurate" pieces [turned out](https://obscuredinosaurfacts.com/blog/post/2020/04/18/aprilart.html), but someone on Deviantart asked me how the promised third installment was coming along, so I felt I had to finish it.  Happily, this one ended up better than the first two.

Somewhere in Late Cretaceous North America, a juvenile *Saurolophus* and *Triceratops*, unlikely friends, encounter a newly hatched *Tyrannosaurus*.  In the original Land Before Time, Chomper was basically just a scaled-down adult, his proportions way too chunky.  My Chomper is at the other extreme, with birdlike twiggy legs and a long face.  Ducky and Cera got more minor updates, with Ducky exchanging her weird hands for hooflike front feet and a quadrupedal stance, and Cera having brow horns (they were born with these) and more than five points on her frill.

I thought I should get some practice sketching from life, or at least from photographs, so here are a few quick gestures of various birds.  I'm pretty happy with how they turned out, especially the crow and emu.

Since that one went so well, I thought I'd repeat the performance, but this time make it into one of those "tag urself" memes.  Tag urself!  I'm Steller's Jay!

Comparing this to Inktober 2019 makes me pretty proud how far I've come in a year and a half.  I think being able to draw digitally makes me want to draw more often, and since artistic skill is directly proportional to number of hours spent doing art, I've seen a lot more improvement since getting my iPad and Apple Pencil.

Unfortunately, my paleoart is not really up to the same level as my photo-reference art.  I think this is because there are a lot of details in texture and lighting that you can just copy without understanding in photos, but for paleoart you have to make up everything.

{% include image-caption.html imageurl="/assets/images/posts/bird-sketches-3.png#wide" title="even more bird sketches" caption="Even more birds sketched from photo reference, some from my own photos.  Some rarer / more specific personality types this time." %}

Toward the end of this batch it was starting to feel more like a chore to complete more birds (and to think of more clever ways to satirize them), so I'm stopping for now.  I'm happy with how they turned out though.

{% include image-caption.html imageurl="/assets/images/posts/teoxys.png#wide" title="Teoxys" caption="Tyrannosaurus in the coloration of the Pokémon Deoxys." %}

Remember when I drew the ["Kings of the Cretaceous"](https://obscuredinosaurfacts.com/blog/post/2020/08/05/summer-art.html) (*Alamosaurus*, *Quetzalcoatlus*, and *Mosasaurus*) in the coloration of the legendary weather trio of Pokémon? (And later, a bunch of convergently clawed herbivores in the coloration of the legendary golems?)  Well, here's the last (or maybe second-to-last) piece in that series: *Tyrannosaurus* in the coloration of Deoxys.  Why?  A lot of people seemed to think *Tyrannosaurus* was missing from the "Kings of the Cretaceous" piece, as the largest land predator ever.  Unfortunately, Deoxys's coloration is pretty bizarre on such a large animal.  It would look more natural on a poisonous frog.

{% include image-caption.html imageurl="/assets/images/pages/snowy-unenlagiine.jpg#wide" title="Snowy unenlagiine" caption="A small unenlagiine hunts among the rocks for worms." %}

I was happy with how my [*Leptostomia* piece](https://obscuredinosaurfacts.com/blog/post/2020/11/25/fall-art.html) came out, so I thought I'd try my hand at some more paleo-Photoshop.  This one is more of a legit Photoshop attempt than my last, which was more of a painting over a photo.

This little dinosaur is supposed to be an unnamed unenlagiine, a member of a family of fish-eating dromaeosaurs (raptor dinosaurs) from Late Cretaceous South America.  Its toes and neck are not quite like those of any known specimen, but they're not out of the range of possibility for that family.  The base image was a snowy egret, a small fish-stalking bird whose habits are probably similar to those of a small unenlagiine.  Sharp-eyed readers may notice that this photo was the reference I used to draw the snowy egret in one of the above sketch collections.
