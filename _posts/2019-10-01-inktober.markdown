For those of you who aren’t familiar with Inktober (and other month-long creativity challenges), it’s a social-media event where participants draw something related to the official prompt, in ink, each day during the month of October.  This is the first time I’ll be participating, so we’ll see how long it takes me to fall off the bandwagon.  Of course, I’m going to do a dinosaur spin on each of the prompts.  Caveat: I’m not a professional paleoartist, so there may be some inaccuracies (and ugliness) even when I try my best; constructive criticism is much appreciated.  Anyway, without further ado, here’s the official list:

![inktober](/assets/inktober.jpg)

And here are my entries so far!  I’ll keep updating this with more as the month goes on.

### Day 1: Ring

![inktober-1](/assets/inktober-1.jpg)

Day 1: Ring - Torosaurus.  Drawn in about 40 minutes from photo reference.

Torosaurus (meaning “perforated lizard”) lived in Latest Cretaceous North America, 68-66 million years ago.  It lived in the same time and place as Triceratops, to whom it was closely related, but it can be distinguished by its large size, short nose horn, and holey frill.  Some paleontologists have suggested that Torosaurus is actually the adult form of Triceratops, but this is not generally accepted.  Torosaurus had a record-breaking 9-foot-long skull, the longest of any land animal; in this picture I’m afraid I didn’t do a great job with the foreshortening, so it doesn’t look as huge and impressive as it should.

I picked Torosaurus to be my “ring” because the holes in its frill are so beautifully round.  It’s a bit of a stretch, but the only alternative I could think of was the enigmatic Ediacaran fossil Cyclomedusa, and with that I had no idea where to start.

### Day 2: Mindless

![inktober-2](/assets/inktober-2.jpg)

Day 2: Mindless - Ctenochasma.  Drawn in about 4 hours.  All that black--never again!

Ctenochasma (meaning “comb jaw”) was a Late Jurassic European cat-sized pterosaur with hundreds of skinny, comb-like teeth that it used to strain water for tiny shellfish like a modern spoonbill.  Too bad it’s Inktober, or I would’ve colored them flamboyant pink.  Here, one Ctenochasma is fishing, one is just chilling, and one is coming in for a landing.  Why are they all facing left?  Maybe it’s windy and they don’t want to get their **pycnofibres** ruffled.  (The real reason is that being [right-handed](https://philarchive.org/archive/TOSWAFv1), I’m much more comfortable drawing animals facing left than right.)

I picked Ctenochasma to be my “mindless” because its inefficient feeding habits probably required it to stand with its face in the water for hours at a time (modern spoonbills do this).  I was debating between this and an ornithopod grazer, but I think I have enough opportunities to do ornithopods in other prompts later in the month.

### Day 3: Bait

![inktober-3](/assets/inktober-3.jpg)

Day 3: Bait - Tanystropheus.  Drawn in about an hour.  Is using sepia pens cheating?

Tanystropheus (say “TAN-ee-STROW-fee-us”) was a Middle Triassic archosauromorph reptile known as the “living fishing rod”.  It was less than 3 feet tall, but 20 feet long, 10 feet of which was neck!  The neck was really stiff, made up of only a few super-elongated vertebrae, allowing Tanystropheus to lean its neck out over the water for long periods while it waited for fish and squid to appear--sort of like a heron, but without actually standing in the water.  Tanystropheus is well-known from many fossils, including a lot of complete skeletons of juveniles, which show that the juveniles were proportionally just mini-adults.  That means their eggs would’ve had to be super long and thin, to fit that stiff neck!

I picked Tanystropheus to be my “bait” because of its claim to fame as the “living fishing rod.”  Even though drawing it only took an hour, I spent another hour researching, because I’m not super familiar with weird Triassic reptiles.  I wanted to get the proportions, posture, and pose right without just copying someone else’s art.  Stylistically, I was going for a sort of ukiyo-e feel, not sure if I succeeded.

### Day 4: Freeze

![inktober-4](/assets/inktober-4.jpg)

Day 4: Freeze - Yutyrannus.  Drawn in about 2 hours.

Yutyrannus (meaning “feather tyrant”) was an Early Cretaceous basal tyrannosauroid from Liaoning (northern China).  It’s by far the largest dinosaur we’ve found with preserved feathers, at around 3,000 pounds, and upon its discovery, paleoartists got super excited at the direct evidence that giant carnivorous dinos could be feathered, and started doing things like this:

![fatbird-trex](/assets/fatbird-trex.jpg)

However, Yutyrannus lived in quite different conditions than Tyrannosaurus--the former lived in a temperate climate that would’ve seen snow in the winter, while the latter lived in a subtropical forested floodplain.  Plus, Tyrannosaurus is about 13 times heavier, and due to the [square-cube law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square%E2%80%93cube_law), would’ve had a much harder time dissipating heat.  In addition to all this, by now many tiny, high-res skin impressions from The King have been found that indicate complete scaliness.

I picked Yutyrannus to be my “freeze” because of the seasonal changes it would’ve experienced in its environment.  Here, Yutyrannus takes a drink at a frozen pond in early winter, reminiscent of that stereotypical wolf picture.  This piece ended up being quite the experiment in textures.  Plants are hard.

### Day 5: Build

![inktober-5](/assets/inktober-5.jpg)

Day 5: Build - Protoceratops.  Drawn in about an hour.

Protoceratops was a small ceratopsian from Late Cretaceous Mongolia.  It lived in the desert alongside Velociraptor, and was probably **cathemeral**, meaning that rather than being nocturnal or diurnal, it was active at sporadic times during the day and night.

I chose Protoceratops to be my “build” because of its fossilized record of extensive nesting behavior.  A Protoceratops nest and a Psittacosaurus nest (another small basal ceratopsian) have been found that each contained lots of yearlings, which means that the young remained in the nest for quite awhile after hatching.  In the case of Psittacosaurus, the nest also contained a subadult that appeared to be babysitting.  All this makes me think that Protoceratops probably cared a lot about how its nest was constructed, inspiring this piece.

An interesting thing to note is the huge number of dinosaurs in these litters--15 for Protoceratops and 24 for Psittacosaurus.  Most animals that care for their offspring only have a few, because of the large amount of resources each one requires.  This is known as **K-strategy** (the K stands for Karrying Kapacity...in German).  On the other hand, animals who have a lot of offspring and don’t care for any of them, like a seahorse, are known as **r-strategists** (the r stands for rate.  Both these terms come from the math behind population dynamics).  These basal ceratopsians show a confusing mix of both strategies--a rather large number of offspring (though 24 babies is still nothing compared to the thousands put out by many sea creatures) with extensive parental and sibling care.

### Day 6: Husky

![inktober-6](/assets/inktober-6.jpg)

Day 6: Husky - Olorotitan.  Drawn in about 4 hours.  All those ovals...

Olorotitan (meaning “swan titan”) was a lambeosaurine “duck-billed” dinosaur from Late Cretaceous Russia.  Lambeosaurinae are the bony-crested subset of hadrosaurs (the soft- or non-crested group is called Saurolophinae), which were medium-sized grazers with advanced chewing abilities--essentially, they filled the same niche as cows do today.  Typically, these guys are pictured as pretty lithe, but in the book All Yesterdays, paleoartist John Conway suggested they may have been a bit more...husky.  This illustration is heavily inspired by his [depiction of Parasaurolophus](https://johnconway.co/ay_parasaurolophus) from that book.

What’s with the huge, dragonlike scales? A [fossil](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/phenomena/2013/12/12/surpise-well-studied-dinosaur-actually-had-a-cocks-comb/) of an Edmontosaurus’s neck and back of head (a related but soft-crested hadrosaur) was found with these huge oval scales preserved. I've seen reconstructions that incorporate the big scales on the neck but show the rest of the body with normal-sized scales, but I thought, why would they stop at the neck?  And so I got myself into a multi-hour circle-drawing predicament.  Here, a bull Olorotitan vegges out.  Look how into himself he is.

### Day 7: Enchanted

![inktober-7](/assets/inktober-7.jpg)

Day 7: Enchanted - Carnotaurus.  Drawn in about 40 minutes.

Carnotaurus (meaning “meat bull”--people often say it means “meat-eating bull,” but it doesn’t) was a Late Cretaceous South American abelisaur, a group of short-faced, medium-sized, leggy carnivores with head ornamentation and comically tiny arms.  They hunted sort of like big cats, biting once and then holding on until the prey was subdued, rather than going for raw bite force--that’s why their skulls are shorter than, say, Tyrannosaurus: Carnotaurus’s jaws were stronger in torsion but worse in compression.  They also weren’t nearly as big; Carnotaurus maxed out at 2.5ish tons, while Tyrannosaurus was about 6 times heavier.

Carnotaurus is known from a single, nearly complete specimen, so while we understand its anatomy well, we don’t know much about its ontogeny or if it exhibited sexual dimorphism.  I went with very little sexual dimorphism in this piece because none is apparent in the closely related Majungasaurus, which is known from many specimens.  The only difference between Mr. and Ms. in this picture is that the lady has skinnier horns, but if they were in color, he would be brightly colored while she would be more plain.

For “enchanted,” I wanted to draw a mating dance, and I picked Carnotaurus because of Trey the Explainer’s [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slcVvR7UMik&t=1401s) and the “pom pom arms” depiction in All Yesterdays.  Their head ornamentation was clearly for display and intra-specific competition (why ram prey if you have a bear trap for a mouth?).  Their tiny arms also had an unusually wide range of motion for a theropod, and could stick straight out, possibly making a striking profile when viewed from the front.  I based the mating dance pose on that of the sharp-tailed grouse, which seemed ideal for showing off the horns, arms, and tail.  Do you think the object of his affection is enchanted, or just humoring him?

### Day 8: Frail

![inktober-8](/assets/inktober-8.jpg)

Day 8: Frail - Scleromochlus.  Drawn in about 30 minutes.  Boing!

Scleromochlus (meaning “hard fulcrum”) was a tiny, desert-dwelling ornithodiran from early Late Triassic Scotland (237-227 million years ago).  It is known from several specimens that tend to come in pairs, and is often cited as an ancestral cousin to pterosaurs.  Various features of its hips and legs indicate that it was a **saltatorial**, or hopping, creature, like a kangaroo or jerboa. Hopping seems to be particularly effective in the desert, since it’s evolved multiple times among desert-dwelling creatures.

I picked Scleromochlus to be my “frail” because its long limbs just look like toothpicks, ready to snap at any provocation.  I considered doing an early leggy dinosauromorph like Lagerpeton or Ixalerpeton, but those are less well-understood and probably didn’t hop so adorably.

### Day 9: Swing

![inktober-9](/assets/inktober-9.jpg)

Day 8: Swing - Megalancosaurus.  Drawn in about an hour.

Megalancosaurus was a Drepanosaur from Late Triassic Italy, one of a family of oddballs highly convergent with chameleons.  They had a clawed tail (the claw was made up of fused vertebrae), two thumbs on their front feet, one or zero thumbs on their back feet (depending on if male or female--how weird is that?) and a pointy head, and were probably insectivorous and arboreal.  Some of them, like Hypuronector, may have even glided between trees.  Here, a Megalancosaurus swings from its tail to catch an insect.  Its humped shoulders provide an attachment site for its strong neck muscles, allowing it to quickly extend its head forward and nab that dragonfly!

### Day 10: Pattern

![inktober-10](/assets/inktober-10.jpg)

Day 10: Pattern - Ornithomimus (chicks).  Drawn in about 40 minutes.

Ornithomimus (meaning “bird mimic”) was an ornithomimid dinosaur from Late Cretaceous North America.  They were extremely convergent with ratites (the family of flightless birds that includes ostriches), but given Ornithomimids did it first, it might be more accurate to say that ratites are ornithomimid mimics.  Ornithomimus had a long neck, long legs, and a little head with a toothless beak.  A specimen found in 2015 with feathers and skin preserved indicates that their integument was _also_ very convergent with ratites, not just their skeletal structure.  We know that Ornithomimus had feathers basically everywhere except its legs, which it probably used for thermoregulation (maybe it even peed on its legs like a vulture to keep cool?  Ideas for NSFW paleoart?), and that adults had **pennaceous** feathers on their arms while juveniles did not, indicating that these feathers were for sexual display.

I picked Ornithomimus to be my “pattern” because baby ostriches have adorable stripes, so it’s not a bad guess to say baby Ornithomimus did too.  Many animals start out life stripy or spotty and then lose the patterning later on when they develop other defenses besides camouflage.
