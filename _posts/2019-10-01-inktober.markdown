For those of you who aren’t familiar with Inktober (and other month-long creativity challenges), it’s a social-media event where participants draw something related to the official prompt, in ink, each day during the month of October.  This is the first time I’ll be participating, so we’ll see how long it takes me to fall off the bandwagon.  Of course, I’m going to do a dinosaur spin on each of the prompts.  Caveat: I’m not a professional paleoartist, so there may be some inaccuracies (and ugliness) even when I try my best; constructive criticism is much appreciated.  Anyway, without further ado, here’s the official list:

And here are my entries so far!  I’ll keep updating this with more as the month goes on.

### Day 1: Ring

Day 1: Ring - Torosaurus.  Drawn in about 40 minutes from photo reference.

Torosaurus (meaning “perforated lizard”) lived in Latest Cretaceous North America, 68-66 million years ago.  It lived in the same time and place as Triceratops, to whom it was closely related, but it can be distinguished by its large size, short nose horn, and holey frill.  Some paleontologists have suggested that Torosaurus is actually the adult form of Triceratops, but this is not generally accepted.  Torosaurus had a record-breaking 9-foot-long skull, the longest of any land animal; in this picture I’m afraid I didn’t do a great job with the foreshortening, so it doesn’t look as huge and impressive as it should.

I picked Torosaurus to be my “ring” because the holes in its frill are so beautifully round.  It’s a bit of a stretch, but the only alternative I could think of was the enigmatic Ediacaran fossil Cyclomedusa, and with that I had no idea where to start.
