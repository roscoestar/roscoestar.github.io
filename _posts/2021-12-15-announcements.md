Hi, just a quick post today. First, MERCH! I know it's a little close to Christmas, but hopefully these make good gifts any time of year. I have a dinosaur coloring book, a deck of cards featuring my bird illustrations with accompanying personalities, a paperback book of bird illustrations with information about each one, and a book version of my [Alphabestiary](https://obscuredinosaurfacts.com/blog/post/2020/03/23/alphabestiary.html) post.  Update: and now also a "pocket" alphabestiary, with 26 new dinosaurs and minimalist illustrations!

Second, I'm going to take a break from posting for the rest of the year, and next year I plan to post only once a month, on the first Wednesday. So look for regularly scheduled content on January 5!

That's all--have a happy holiday and see y'all next year. Thanks for reading.
