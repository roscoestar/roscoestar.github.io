*Anzu* was a large **oviraptorosaur** with a toothless beak and an impressive head crest.  It was North America’s largest oviraptorosaur (and by far the most well-known to science), and the third-largest in the world (*Gigantoraptor*, from a bit earlier in Mongolia, is a lot larger, and *Beibeilong*, though only known from a fetus, would've grown comparably huge).  *Anzu* was probably omnivorous and not picky, and was a good runner.  The crest was probably used for sexual display, leading some to speculate that Anzu may have exhibited **sexual dimorphism**, with major visual differences between males and females. Caenagnathidae (pronounced SEEN-a-NATH-id-ay), the family that includes *Anzu*, means “recently jawless” and is the **sister clade** to Oviraptoridae (which includes *Oviraptor*).  Weird holes in caenagnathids' lower jaws, along with their overall very birdlike appearance, initially made scientists think they were extinct ratite birds, like ostriches, before they realized they were actually non-avian dinosaurs.

*Anzu* was part of the famous Hell Creek biota alongside such fan favorites as *Tyrannosaurus*, *Triceratops*, and *Pachycephalosaurus*.  66 million years ago, it was among the unfortunate direct victims of the Very Bad Day.

*Anzu* is named after a Sumerian mythological demon whom it somewhat resembles (center, below).

#### Note 1: What’s that eye bone thing?
It’s called a **sclerotic ring**, a special bone that supports the eyeball, which is useful if it’s particularly large or not spherical.  It’s common among all groups of vertebrates except modern mammals and crocodiles.  Read more about it [here (less technical)](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-dinosaurs-have-rings-of-bones-in-their-eye-sockets) and [here (more technical)](https://bryangee.weebly.com/blog/i-spy-with-my-not-so-little-eye).

#### Note 2: How many times have beaks evolved independently?
A lot! Birds, oviraptorosaurs like *Anzu*, cephalopods (octopuses and squids), turtles, pterosaurs, monotremes (platypuses and echidnas), parrotfish, certain ornithischians, dicynodonts (a type of stem-mammal), certain pseudosuchians like *Lotosaurus* and *Effigia* (crocodile relatives), rhynchosaurs (early reptiles), therizinosaurs, ornithomimids, and even some ceratosaurs like *Limusaurus* all had **keratinous** beaks.  And that’s not even a comprehensive list.  Beaks are both very useful and very easy to make, evolutionarily--they are a very **homoplastic** trait.  This is another example of [convergent evolution](http://obscuredinosaurfacts.com/blog/post/2019/09/06/convergent-evolution.html).
