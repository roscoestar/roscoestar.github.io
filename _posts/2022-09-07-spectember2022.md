If you've hung around this blog for awhile, you may have seen my participation in Inktober in [2019](https://obscuredinosaurfacts.com/blog/post/2019/10/01/inktober.html) and [2020](https://obscuredinosaurfacts.com/blog/post/2020/09/30/inktober-2.html) (and last year, [Botober](https://obscuredinosaurfacts.com/blog/post/2021/10/20/botober.html)), the month-long event in which every day there's a different prompt, which participants use as inspiration for a daily ink drawing. I'm a little burnt out on Inktober (I prefer digital art), but I did want to do some kind of art challenge. So this year I'm doing "Spectember", a speculative evolution event! Speculative evolution is when you either take a concept, such as "life on a high-gravity world" or "what if another group of vertebrates could fly" or "what kind of animal would be the best [triathlete](https://obscuredinosaurfacts.com/blog/post/2019/11/13/triathlon.html)", or an end result, such as Godzilla or [creatures from a certain viedo game](https://obscuredinosaurfacts.com/blog/post/2019/09/08/spec-evo-mh.html), and try to use the real constraints of evolution and actual living things to explain or create an organism.

Here are Spectember's prompts:

I'm going to do most of them, but not all--some of the prompts that reference outdated concepts or just don't spark inspiration for me, I'm going to skip. Also, September is just beginning, so I haven't finished all the entries yet. Check back later to see more!

Before we get started, here are some cartoons I made featuring a very famous speculative evolution creature: "dinosauroids", the intelligent species that results if the asteroid had not wiped out non-avian dinosaurs. They're descendants of a "raptor" dinosaur, or possibly even an early bird, which were the smartest animals at the end of the Mesozoic.

### Day 1: Robust Reptiles

Pareiasaurs were a group of early reptiles from the Permian period, 265 to 252 million years ago (the last period before the Mesozoic Era, or Age of Dinosaurs). They were large, bulky herbivores that often had **osteoderms** (bony armor), bumpy horns on their heads, and an upright posture. They went extinct, along with most Permian animals, in the Great Dying, the mass extinction at the end of that period.

If a small group of them made it through the Great Dying, where would they be today? We no longer have any cold-blooded megaherbivores, so I tried to think of a role in which ectothermy would be an advantage. Bulk feeding of poor-quality fodder might be one such niche, but ungulates have grasslands on lock, and ectotherms can't exist above certain latitudes. So, my pareiasaur descendant is a pine needle specialist that lives in the temperate conifer forests of the Pacific Northwest. Hardly anything eats pine needles in real life, so it's free real estate!

The "nothro" in *Nothropareia* means "sloth", since the animal ended up looking a lot like a reptilian version of a giant ground sloth. Perhaps slow metabolism was one reason sloths were so good at the megaherbivore role in the past--*Nothropareia* would have done it better!

### Day 3: The Thing

I haven't seen the movie *The Thing*, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't *technically* use biomimicry--it's more like a body snatcher--and it also doesn't limit itself to preying on humans. Anyway...

Bladderwort is an aquatic carnivorous plant with a worldwide distribution that deserves more recognition. Everyone knows of Venus fly traps and lots have heard of pitcher plants and sundews, but there are two other kinds of carnivorous plant that are less well-known: lobster pots, which are kind of like horizontal pitcher plants that have sharp, inward-angled spines that allow the prey to move forward along the tunnel but not backward, and bladderworts, which have definitely the coolest and most complicated trap. Each tiny trap, of which each plant has hundreds, consists of a pouch, a trapdoor, and trigger stalks. The plant actively pumps water out of the pouch, creating a vacuum inside; the trigger stalks are just mechanical levers that break the seal, allowing water to rush in. Contrast this with the Venus fly trap, whose trigger hairs act more like an animal's nervous system by sending a signal to the hinge to prompt it to close. In a bladderwort, the only active part is pumping out the water; then the trap is set and the plant can just sit back and enjoy its tiny meals.

A giant bladderwort maybe could have evolved by incrementally targeting larger prey: first it would go from rotifers to arthropods, then to small fish, then larger fish, and so on (which means that if a giant bladderwort exists, then a large, medium, and small bladderwort probably exist alongside it). As its bladders get bigger, they get fewer, until the giant bladderwort only has one trap left.

*Utricularia* is the genus of real bladderwort, so *Gigautricularia* just means "giant bladderwort".

Some people have informed me that this looks like "vore", a fetish some people have for things eating girls. I apologize, any similarity is unintentional.

### Day 5: Class Act

Since the tree of life is constantly branching, taxonomic "levels" like Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, et cetera, are mostly meaningless. The only level with any real-world meaning is Species, defined as the largest group of organisms in which any two of appropriate genders could mate and produce fertile offspring, but even that has exceptions.

The five commonly cited "classes" within vertebrates are fish, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and birds. However, [as I've discussed before](https://obscuredinosaurfacts.com/blog/post/2019/09/06/i-am-a-fish.html), birds nest within reptiles, and all of them nest within fish.  Enough about the letter of the prompt though, what's the spirit? Reptiles and birds, the most closely related distinct "classes", last shared a common ancestor around 247 million years ago, in the Middle Triassic. So any "sixth class" should share a common ancestor that far back, or earlier.

I always thought it was unfair that reptiles got two "class" entries and mammals only one. So here's my take on a mammal-like animal that split off from the mammal lineage during the Permian. It's a therapsid, but not a cynodont; other than that I didn't have anything specific in mind as its direct ancestor.

*Ailurophis* literally means "cat snake".

### Day 6: Downforce

This one has a lot of text on the card, so I'll just let you read that instead of overexplaining here.

### Day 7: Superfood Sapindales

Sapindales (pronounced sap-in-DAY-lees) is the family of plants containing citrus, lychee, mango, maple, cashew, and many others. I'm not sure why the r/SpeculativeEvolution people chose this particular family as the source of our new super-crop, but there you are.

In real life, each cashew nut is encased in a shell that causes a poison-ivy-like reaction, and is attached to a small accessory fruit known as a "casheew apple" that's said to taste something like a bland peach or a crunchy plantain that makes your mouth leathery. It's commonly made into pastes and jams in South and Central America, but not widely known elsewhere.

Whenever people advocate fruit or fruit juice as a health food, I remind them that fruits are evolutionarily supposed to be as tasty as possible, not particularly healthy. If a plant could grow a Snickers bar, it probably would.  So this is my attempt at speculatively evolving that.

### Day 9: Florafauna

Mammals living inside plants in a mutually beneficial relationship already happens in real life: [Indonesian wooly bats](https://commonnaturalist.com/2016/05/13/the-bats-that-live-in-carnivorous-plants/) make their roosts inside normally carnivorous pitcher plants, which provide shelter in exchange for nitrogen-rich bat poo. However, I wanted to do something completely different.

![potoroo](/assets/images/posts/potoroo.png)

The spread of cinnamon fungus *Phytophthora cinnamomi* is currently wreaking havoc on Australia's forest biomes. It's treatable, but incurable, and since a lot of these forests are quite remote, the fungus is mostly spreading unchecked through wild lands. It's quite versatile, and able to infect all kinds of trees, some of which are important crops, like avocado.

Potoroos and bettongs are rabbit-sized bipedal marsupials native to Australia that are some of the only mammals to specialize on eating fungus. In real life, they mostly eat mushrooms, which are the fruits of fungus, rather than mycelium, which make up the main underground body, and sometimes even run *through* plant cells. I've left the mechanism by which potoroos are able to extract mycelium without harming the plant up to the reader's imagination.

### Day 11: Speculative Bertology

I'm really curious to see what other people come up with for this one. Aliens? Future descendants of humans that have fewer fingers and exaggerated facial features?

![berterpillar](/assets/images/posts/berterpillar.png)

As unlikely as this seems, caterpillars and lepidopterans (butterflies and moths) do a lot of very strange things when it comes to coloration, body structures, and mimicry. Some caterpillars have retractable tentacles, horns, or brushy structures that they use for defense; others are covered in toxic spines, irritating hairs, or shape-concealing fluff. Some have structures that look like convincing snake heads, and one of them is literally the [Pokémon](https://archives.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Category:Caterpie) [Caterpie](https://scontent-sjc3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.18169-9/14141947_1207716732601609_5858353749821682547_n.jpg?_nc_cat=101&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=973b4a&_nc_ohc=gPX5WeHn5zYAX8fksfb&_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.xx&oh=00_AT_DBnNy5u3gg3jpcvHMD45cO147kuDcZ8eOb00-f-Y1Cw&oe=633F0ED1).

**Aposematism** is when something dangerous or toxic has flashy colors or patterns as a warning to would-be predators. **Batesian mimicry** is when something not dangerous imitates something dangerous. **Mullerian mimicry** is when multiple dangerous things look the same as each other, so that predators only have to learn one type of pattern to stay away from (like bees and wasps with their warning-sign yellow and black stripes).
