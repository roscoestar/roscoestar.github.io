After finishing the Alphabestiary, I've been trying a couple new art formats: bird-inspired portraits, and gesture sheets.  For the former, I start with a photo reference of a suitably primeval-looking bird, and draw a dinosaur in its plumage.  See my post on [archosaur integument](http://obscuredinosaurfacts.com/blog/post/2019/11/16/fuzz.html) for which dinosaurs were likely to have what types of plumage.  For the latter, I sketch four or more varying poses of the same critter in an effort to show more than one aspect or angle of the subject.  Without further ado, here they are!

#### Pakasuchus
![pakasuchus](/assets/pakasuchus.png)

Pakasuchus, meaning "cat crocodile," was a notosuchian from late Early Cretaceous Tanzania.  It had mammal-like heterodont teeth, with canines, premolars, and molars that would've allowed it to chew.  It had reduced armor along its body but retained a heavily armored tail for some reason.  I've given my Pakasuchus speculative ear pinnae, since osteological correlates (bone textures) in advanced notosuchians have hinted at an external earflap-like structure, but we don't know the extent of these structures.  Here, it's engaging in various catlike poses.  10/10 would pet.  If you're familiar with my prior work, this is the third notosuchian I've decked out in ears; in Inktober I drew Araripesuchus as being convergent with a wolf, and around Christmastime I drew Baurusuchus in the form factor of a lion.

#### Dineobellator

It's the brand-new velociraptorine from Latest Cretaceous New Mexico, Dineobellator (meaning "Navajo warrior")!  Described just this year, this is just the third end-Cretaceous dromaeosaur known from North America (the other two being Dakotaraptor, described 2015, and Acheroraptor, described 2013.  So we didn't know that ANY dromaeosaurs lived in North America at that time until 2013!)  Here, he's exhibiting four emotional states: angry, casual, excited, and cold.

#### Latenivenatrix
![latenivenatrix](/assets/latenivenatrix.png)

I was inspired to start doing these feathery portraits because of a photo of a harpy eagle I stumbled upon on Reddit.  It looked both so primeval and full of personality, I wanted to see what it would look like as a non-avian dinosaur.  Latenivenatrix was a large troodontid from Late Cretaceous Alberta.  It's currently the largest troodontid known, at around 3.5m long (Deinonychus-sized).  Its name means "hiding huntress" (-venatrix is the female form of -venator, mneaning "hunter").  I like how the head feathers look sort of like a barette or something, making her look more fancy and feminine.  Fun fact, this dinosaur is what I named my new bicycle after.  I call it "Lottie" for short.

#### Hesperonychus
![hesperonychus](/assets/hesperonychus.png)

Hesperonychus was a very small (1-2 pound) microraptorine dromaeosaur from Late Cretaceous North America.  This was a huge range extension for the clade Microraptoria, since they were previously known only from Early Cretaceous Asia.  This Hesperonychus is dressed up as a black palm cockatoo.  I think I half-accidentally captured the shape of the microraptorine skull pretty well, but I could've done better with making the feathers more iridescent.

#### Thescelosaurus

Thescelosaurus was a large (200-300kg) parksosaurid ornithischian from Latest Cretaceous North America.  It had both teeth toward the back of its snout and a beak on the tip.  This one is dressed up as a wood grouse or capercaillie.

#### Siamraptor
![siamraptor](/assets/siamraptor.png)

Siamraptor was a medium-sized (8-meter) carcharodontosaur from Early Cretaceous Thailand (Yutyrannus-sized or a bit smaller).  There are not a whole lot of dinosaurs currently known from Southeast Asia, and this one was the first carcharodontosaur known from that region, described just last year.  Here I've given him the plumage of a Philippine eagle.

Usually when I draw scales, I do about 20% of them and then use Procreate's "clone" tool to make the rest.  But that results in visible seams between cloned sections.  So this time, I actually drew _every circle_ by hand!  I think it was worth it though.

#### Buitreraptor
![buitreraptor](/assets/buitreraptor.jpg)

Here's another bird-inspired portrait: Buitreraptor dressed as a hamerkop (not a shoebill, but a close relative).  Buitreraptor was a small unenlagiine dromaeosaur from Late Cretaceous Argentina.  This is the same group that includes Unenlagia and Austroraptor, who I've drawn before.  They were long-snouted, putative piscivores that populated the Southern Hemisphere toward the end of the Mesozoic.  Here, Buitreraptor rests with its neck retracted and chest feathers puffed up, giving it a compact "aeroshell" look, even though its neck is actually quite long.  Read more about it [here](http://willoughbyart.blogspot.com/2012/07/the-neck-is-lie.html).

#### Just For Fun: Land Before Time But More Accurate
I'm surprised that it seems like nobody's done this before.  Land Before Time popularized dinosaurs before Jurassic Park--the first movie came out in 1988--and consistent with the times, its depiction of dinosaurs have quite a few inaccuracies.  The main offense though is their compressing the entire Mesozoic world into one time and location.  Remember, Stegosaurus was more ancient to Tyrannosaurus than Tyrannosaurus is to the iPhone!  So, to start with, I've broken the "gang" into three groups that could have more plausibly lived alongside one another.

![rubypetrie](/assets/rubypetrie.png)

Here's a scene from early Late Cretaceous (86-84 Ma) Mongolia.  A curious young Oviraptor encounters something she's never seen before: a stray Pteranodon flapling, blown astray from Canada by a storm.  Major differences from the original character designs include: Petrie's wings actually have bones in them (they're not just a cape) and he's quadrupedal on the ground; Ruby is fully feathered and winged, and her pennaceous feathers are in logical places, ie wings and tail and not randomly on her back and neck.

In the Late Jurassic (152-151 Ma) of what is now North America, a juvenile Apatosaurus and Stegosaurus share a cycad for lunch.
