I was inspired by the awesome paleoart blog, [Nix Draws Stuff](https://alphynix.tumblr.com), who did a dinosaur "alphabestiary" a few years ago.  Here is my own attempt at one dinosaur per letter per day.  I'm not finished yet, but I'll keep updating this as I go!

#### A is for Animantarx

Animantarx (meaning "living fortress") was a smallish nodosaur from early Late Cretaceous Utah.  Nodosaurs were the armored ones that did not have tail weapons, ankylosaurs being the ones that did.  From this angle, I can really see how they're related to stegosaurs (both ankylosaurs and stegosaurs are in the family Thyreophora).  Ankylosaurs may have used their snoots to dig up roots and tubers.  Originally this pose was intended to show that, but then I didn't draw the dirt, so it just looks like he's walking.  Oh well, we know that ankylosaurs almost certainly did engage in walking.

#### B is for Bambiraptor

Bambiraptor was a dromaeosaur from Late Cretaceous Montana.  Yes, it is named after the Disney character.  It is unusual in possibly having opposable thumbs, and arm flexibility that would've allowed it to put things in its mouth.  Here, I've drawn it with its neck retracted and its feathers forming an "aeroshell," disguising the neck's true length.  This is something modern birds do [frequently](http://willoughbyart.blogspot.com/2012/07/the-neck-is-lie.html).  It's also interacting with some kind of lepidopteran, which did exist at the time.  Technically, we don't know that Bambiraptor _wasn't_ colored like this.

#### C is for Concavenator

Concavenator is supposed to mean Cuenca hunter, but to me it always looked like someone who will concave you.  So here it is in the style of the retro Terminator movie poster.

Concavenator was a small carcharodontosaur (descendant of the earlier allosauroids) from Early Cretaceous Spain.  It had two unusually tall neural spines on two of its vertebrae near the hips, indicating that it had some kind of sail or hump.  Most sailed animals have way more than two vertebrae involved, so in comparison Concavenator's sail is somewhat abrupt.

There's a lot of debate about whether or not some bumps on Concavenator's lower arm represent feather attachment points, but since the animal was smaller than Yutyrannus, I felt justified in giving it a full body feathering.

Drawing long-snouted creatures from the front is hard.  I used a photo of a Carcharodontosaurus skull from this angle as reference, and it still turned out wonky.

#### D is for Drinker
![drinker](/assets/drinker.jpg)

Actually, as of last year, the five genera Drinker, Othnielia, Othnielosaurus, Laosaurus, and Nanosaurus were all lumped under the banner of Nanosaurus, making the rest junior synonyms.

Nanosaurus was a small (20-pound) neornithischian from Late Jurassic North America.  Its remains were originally found by the Bone Warrior, Othniel Charles Marsh (after whom Othnielia and Othnielosaurus were later named), while Drinker was named for his rival, Edward Drinker Cope, who did not find any Nanosaurus remains.  These little beaked herbivores had a lacrimal bone in their skulls that gave them a perpetual angry look.  Here, a herd of Nanosaurus drinks at a watering hole while one looks out for predators.

People often illustrate small neornithischians as being covered in quills, but since most modern animals aren't quilly, I went with a shorthair look instead.  I think my Nanosaurus ended up looking too bulky and muscular for how small they should be.

#### E is for Ekrixinatosaurus
![ekrixinatosaurus](/assets/ekrixinatosaurus.jpg)

Ekrixinatosaurus, meaning "explosion-born reptile," was an abelisaur from Late Cretaceous Argentina.  These were medium-sized, short-faced, long-legged, puny-armed theropods that were the dominant carnivores in the Southern Hemisphere at the time (tyrannosaurs ruled the Northern).  Ekrixinatosaurus is called that because its holotype was discovered during explosive excavation for the laying of a gas pipeline--not because of something about volcanoes.  (Volcanoes are a bit of a paleoart cliche.)  Anyway, here's Ekrixinatosaurus in the style of the 2014 Pompeii movie poster.  I'm really happy with how the dinosaur itself turned out; less so with the background.

#### F is for Fruitadens (and Fruitafossor)
![fruitadens](/assets/fruitadens.jpg)

Fruitadens (meaning "Fruita's tooth") was a heterodontosaurid from Late Jurassic Colorado.  It is the smallest-known ornithischian, at just under a foot long and weighing 1-2 pounds.  Even so, it's larger than the 2-ounce mammal, Fruitafossor (meaning "Fruita's digger").  Fruitafossor had burly "Popeye arms" for digging, and anteater-like teeth specialized for crunching termites.  Here, Fruitafossor defends its burrow in the roots of a yew-like tree from a Fruitadens that wandered too close, seeking the fallen false-fruit (true fruiting plants, angiosperms, didn't exist yet).  Fruit fruit fruit.

Heterodontosaurids were herbivores, but they had large tusk-like canine teeth, either for defense or for intraspecific competition.  They also had lacrimal bones in their skulls that made them look really angry all the time.
