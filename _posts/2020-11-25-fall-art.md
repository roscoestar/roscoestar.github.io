![caelestiventus](/assets/images/posts/caelestiventus.png)

*Caelestiventus* (meaning "heavenly wind"--what a great name for a prehistoric beast) was a dimorphodontid pterosaur from Late Triassic Utah, which was then a desert environment.  It was large for an early pterosaur and probably specialized for its extreme environment, indicating potential higher diversity among this group than we'd previously thought.  I was inspired by the way vampire bats move on the ground (check out the documentary series "Night On Earth" for incredible footage of vampire bats preying on fur seal pups and all kinds of other cool stuff)--their wings fold up and you can't even tell they could fly until they do--and wanted to see if I could figure out how these weird, membrany animals might look in various poses.  I'm not sure I'm happy with how they turned out, but I learned a lot while doing it at least.  I think this is a brother-sister subadult pair, the male having the large chin crest.

![which-is-cooler](/assets/images/posts/which-is-cooler.png)

Inspired by one of the end-of-year questions from 2018 on the Common Descent Podcast, I thought I'd tackle the speculative evolution problem, "Which is cooler: a snake convergent with crocs, or a croc convergent with snakes?"

*Champsoidoboa* ("croc-like boa"), in yellow, is a descendent of a green anaconda, which are already semi-aquatic predators.  Over time, it became more of a shoreline ambush predator, making its body shorter and re-developing its spurs as much as it could in order to give its strike more oomph.  Its jaws are very modified from its ancestor's as well, with much more bone fusion, less flexibility, and conical, rather than needle-like, teeth.

*Pseudophisuchus* ("false snake croc"), in blue, is a descendent of the saltwater crocodile, which became more aquatic over time, elongating its body in order to better undulate and shortening its face like *Dakosaurus*.  Perhaps it lives in large reefs, and reduced its legs so it could fit into tight spaces.  Someone pointed out that it looks like Typhlosion without legs, which now I can't unsee.

I think *Pseudophisuchus* is more of an exciting creature design, but *Champsoidoboa* is more plausible.

It's *Lystrosaurus declivis*, the little stem-mammal that conquered the world after the Great Dying, feeding on a leafy sprout in the Early Triassic.  To me, *Lystrosaurus* seems like the synapsid version of a turtle--short-faced, slow-moving, hardy, vegetarian, and able to hibernate.

I was trying out an amazing new foliage brush set by [TamberElla](https://www.deviantart.com/tamberella).  My skill with them is poor--don't judge the brushes by me, haha.

![acro](/assets/images/posts/acro.png)

In 2016, some very large fossilized scratch marks were uncovered in the Dakota Sandstone of Colorado that were named *Ostenichnus bilobatus* and were diagnosed as being part of a very large theropod's mating display.  While it's hard to confidently match a trace fossil with a trace-maker, *Acrocanthosaurus* is a good bet, since it matches the time, place, and size.  This dinosaur could weigh up to 6 tonnes, so I couldn't give him a full fluffy coat, but since it presumably engaged in lekking behavior, I wanted to give him some flashy feathers to go along with his ritual ground-scraping.  The feathers, of course, are inspired by the golden-collared manakin, a sub-one-ounce bird from Panama.  I just thought the raisable/lowerable beard crest that's sort of the inverse of a jay's head crest, was really interesting.

![leptostomia](/assets/images/posts/leptostomia.png)

This is my first attempt at photo manipulation, and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.  Remember my [photo](https://obscuredinosaurfacts.com/blog/post/2020/10/28/dinophoto3.html) of a willet on a mud-flat, catching an invertebrate?  I thought it would be a good template for showcasing the new tiny mud-probing pterosaur, *Leptostomia*.  I had a lot of freedom to make his anatomy match the willet's, since *Leptostomia* is only known from a skull.  I also gave him a heron's kinked neck for a fast, lever-driven strike.

Some research by Emerald Bender presented at SVP this year indicated that ceratopsians' horns and frills were probably strictly decorative, and not often used in intraspecific combat or defense.  While this has been assumed for awhile about the frills, which are sometimes paper-thin and have a ridiculous amount of variation between genera, the horns being decorative is a new idea that implies fun coloration on the horns themselves.  This is a portrait of the novataxon *Stellasaurus* in the style of artist [Andreas Preis](https://andreaspreis.com/).  MAN is this style time-consuming!  I like how it turned out, but I'm not sure if I'm going to do any more of these.  See my [Deviantart page](https://www.deviantart.com/roscoestar/art/Stellasaurus-coloring-page-861395766) for a coloring-book version!

![proburnetia](/assets/images/posts/proburnetia2.png)

A kitsune mask?  A dragon?  No, it's *Proburnetia*, the dog-sized bump-headed Permian biarmosuchian (a type of stem mammal).  This animal had lots of bizarre bumps all over its skull, which I'm interpreting as anchor points for impressive horns, like how *Pachyrhinosaurus* is often depicted nowadays.  This isn't a new idea--check out [this](https://www.deviantart.com/pterosaur-freak/art/Proburnetia-723474412) very draconic reconstruction.  Biarmosuchians were cold-blooded, so they wouldn't've had fur, but I tried to give it a snout reminiscent of mammals.  The result is this highly fantastic, highly speculative dragon-tiger thing.

I decided to make my own interpretation of Andreas Preis's style for this one and do patterns inspired by *azulejos* (Portuguese traditional painted tiles) in the colored regions instead of just overlapping striped ribbons.  I'm not sure it's any good; I think maybe I mixed too many styles and the result is incoherent.  The overall shapes involved, composition, and coloration are reminiscent of Japanese kitsune or kabuki masks, which don't mix super readily with the Portuguese *azulejos*.

Anyway, now I'm officially done with these.  I also made this one into a [coloring page](https://www.deviantart.com/roscoestar/art/Proburnetia-coloring-page-862104378) if you're interested in some paleo Zen time.
