Family tree: Theropoda > Tetanurae > Coelurosauria > Tyrannosauroidea > Tyrannosauridae > Tyrannosaurinae

Hometown: Mongolia, 70-66 million years ago (Latest Cretaceous)

Discovered 1946, described 1955 by Evgeny Maleev

I hope you've been watching *Prehistoric Planet*, the new BBC documentary series narrated by Sir David Attenborough, and the spiritual successor to *Walking With Dinosaurs*.  The animation is spectacular, the dinosaurs are modern and behave like animals, and some of the speculations are straight out of *All Yesterdays*.  I'll write a post with my thoughts on the series in a couple weeks, but for now I'm going to focus on one of the dinosaurs featured in the "Deserts" episode: *Tarbosaurus*. (I actually wanted to do a profile of *Tarbosaurus* before the show came out, but now I can also talk about how it was portrayed for some extra content! Fortuitous!)

### Comparison with *Tyrannosaurus*

*Tarbosaurus* (meaning "alarming reptile") was the top predator in Latest Cretaceous China and Mongolia, filling a *similar* (though not exactly the same, as we'll see later) role as its relative *Tyrannosaurus* did in North America. These deep-skulled, peg-toothed, barrel-chested, tiny-armed predators were built for walking long distances in pursuit of large prey--in North America, *Tyrannosaurus* would have taken down *Edmontosaurus* and *Triceratops*, while in Asia *Tarbosaurus* hunted sauropods like *Nemegtosaurus* and *Opisthocoelicaudia* as well as hadrosaurs like *Saurolophus* and even the giant ornithomimosaur *Deinocheirus*.

However, while these two tyrant reptiles have a lot of superficial similarities, there are notable differences between them as well.  This makes their evolutionary relationships convoluted and constantly being revised.  Here's a handy chart to get us started:

| ***Tyrannosaurus***                       | ***Tarbosaurus***                      |
| Short, deep skull                         | Short, deep skull                      |
| Could crush bone                          | Could crush bone                       |
| Hunted large prey                         | Hunted VERY large prey                 |
| Tiny arms                                 | The tiniest arms relative to body size |
| 7-10+ tonnes                              | 2-4 tonnes                             |
| Good sense of smell, hearing, balance     | Good sense of smell, hearing, balance  |
| Good eyesight, steroscopic vision         | Poor eyesight, monoscopic vision       |
| Bite force transmitted through nose ridge | Bite force bypasses nose               |
| Flexible lower jaw                        | Stiff lower jaw with locking mechanism |
| Juveniles most numerous                   | Adults most numerous                   |

Since *Tyrannosaurus* and *Tarbosaurus* look so similar at a glance, *Tarbosaurus* was initially classified as a species of *Tyrannosaurus*, and is still sometimes referred to as such (especially when marketing is important, due to the superior name recognition). But digging deeper, the large differences in their skull mechanics suggest that maybe they aren't as closely related as originally thought.  The much smaller, long-snouted contemporary *Alioramus* is the only known tyrannosaur that shares the jaw locking mechanism and the details of *Tarbosaurus*'s bite force transmission. But the way the tyrannosaur family tree is currently organized places *Alioramus* on a distant branch and *Tarbosaurus* nested deep within a group containing other large-bodied, deep-snouted animals. If *Alioramus* is in fact *Tarbosaurus*'s closest relative, the tree will have to undergo quite a shuffle.

There's a slightly more ancient large-bodied, deep-snouted tyrannosaur known from China, called *Zhuchengtyrannus*, which shares its jaw features with *Tyrannosaurus* rather than *Tarbosaurus*, confusing things further. It's possible that *Zhuchengtyrannus* is a cousin of *Tyrannosaurus* whose ancestors migrated across the Bering land bridge from North America, and after it died out, *Tarbosaurus* convergently evolved bone-crushing features. Or, *Tarbosaurus* evolved *Alioramus*-like jaw features convergently, for some reason possibly related to being small relative to its prey size.

Unlike *Tyrannosaurus*, which definitely could see you even if you were not moving, *Tarbosaurus* seemed to rely more on its other senses to hunt. *Tyrannosaurus*'s skull flared in the back, allowing its eyes to face forward and granting good depth perception, while *Tarbosaurus*'s skull was more slender side to side, and its eyes faced mostly sideways.  Endocasts of the two animals' brains also show that while *Tyrannosaurus* had well-developed brain structures associated with vision, *Tarbosaurus* did not.  And despite the fact that *Tarbosaurus* was less than half the weight of *Tyrannosaurus*, it took on larger prey: while the largest thing *Tyrannosaurus* had available to it was the up-to-9-tonne *Edmontosaurus*, the Asian sauropod *Opisthocoelicaudia* would have weighed 20 to 25 tonnes. This, coupled with the fact that *Tarbosaurus* adults were much more common in their environment than juveniles, while with *Tyrannosaurus* the opposite was true, indicates that their hunting styles and lifestyles were quite different. Perhaps *Tyrannosaurus* was a more solitary hunter, while *Tarbosaurus* was more cooperative. (This is the stance taken in *Prehistoric Planet*.)

In spite of the fact that *Tarbosaurus* had proportionally the tiniest arms of any tyrannosaur, stress fractures on the hand bones of one fossil suggest that they habitually used their hands for *something*. Or at least that one specimen did--it's possible that it was some kind of tic.

A study on the one known juvenile *Tarbosaurus* specimen's sclerotic rings, or eye bones, suggested that it might be nocturnal or **crepuscular** (active at dawn and dusk); it seems likely that the adults would have been as well, given the harshness of daytime in their desert environment. (Sclerotic ring material isn't known from any adult specimens.) That's why I depicted my *Tarbosaurus* in the page image up top as being up in the early dawn. Maybe he is finding a nice shady spot to sleep away the heat of the day. I also gave him a speculative dewlap, since one specimen was reported to preserve some kind of gular pouch or other soft-tissue throat structure, but this claim was never officially published. I gave him open-habitat countershading as well--clean lines, with the white of the belly starting high up on the side body.

### Prehistoric Planet

In *Prehistoric Planet*, *Tarbosaurus* is featured in a couple of scenes in the "Deserts" episode. First, a pride of *Tarbosaurus* are shown napping around a sauropod carcass in the blistering midday heat, guarding it from circling pterosaurs and prowling *Velociraptor*, while the flies buzzing all around attract lizards.  That scene is cool for a couple reasons.  It displays the entire desert food chain, reminding the audience that dinosaurs lived in a complex environment with many trophic levels much like today. And the carcass-guarding behavior shown is quite a common carnivore habit; lions and hyenas, among others, are known to do this (*Tarbosaurus* is likened ecologically to lions in many ways during this episode). My only complaint is that all the animals are out in the sun during the stated 60C (140F) summer heat. The *Tarbosaurus* are at least resting to keep their body temperatures down, but couldn't they be resting in the shade of the boulders that are everywhere in the landscape?

![tarbo-deino2](/assets/images/posts/tarbo-deino2.png)

Above: While *Tarbosaurus* and *Deinocheirus* never met in the show, they did meet in real life.

In the second scene, lots of herbivores are gathered at a watering hole that's temporarily pooled in the high desert. A lone *Tarbosaurus* appears in the distance, and the music makes you think it's going to attack and spoil the party, but instead it just comes and gets a drink while the herbivores give it a wide berth. This is another tableau from the modern African savanna with large mammal roles switched out for dinosaurs--zebras, giraffes, elephants, and other large herbivores congregate at watering holes, and when lions show up everyone usually manages to keep the peace. (It's often the rhinos that cause the most trouble.) I like the way that the *Tarbosaurus* is shown to drink by scooping, like a bird.

![tarbo-at-water](/assets/images/posts/tarbo-at-water.jpg)

In terms of how *Tarbosaurus* looks, I wouldn't say it's a particularly attractive creature design, but you can't fault the scientific accuracy. Its head and body are significantly differently shaped than the show's model of *Tyrannosaurus*--the head is much slimmer, with the characteristic sideways-facing eyes, and the body is a lot less barrel-chested. While *Tyrannosaurus* is completely featherless, as is the consensus nowadays due to numerous skin impressions, *Tarbosaurus* has a smattering of mangy-looking bristles that would help to dissipate heat like radiator fins (this is why elephants retain their sparse hair). This is a cool idea that takes our modern knowledge that ancestral tyrannosauroids were fully feathered and applies it to make adaptive sense in the context of the desert environment.  I'm not a huge fan of the jaguar-like spots--and in general, this show probably overrepresents spotted and striped animals for the sake of pretty visuals--but I think they were intended to be reminiscent of those of spotted hyenas, suggesting convergence, given their similar ecological niche.

And while *Tyrannosaurus* is shown alone, in pairs, and with juveniles, *Tarbosaurus* is shown living in a pride of multiple adults, which is consistent with the fossil evidence. Overall, a very admirable portrayal of this dinosaur!

### Fossil Poaching Controversy

Another claim to fame for *Tarbosaurus* was its involvement in celebrity auctions and fossil poaching scandals between 2007 and 2012. Mongolia and China have strict laws about removing fossils from the country in which they're found, and since *Tarbosaurus* is known only from those two countries, fossils belonging to that genus that turn up anywhere else in the world are definitely smuggled.  Against a background stream of other, lower-profile smuggled fossils coming out of Mongolia, a *Tarbosaurus* skull illegally taken from Mongolia, advertised as "*Tyrannosaurus bataar*" for added sexiness, got bidded up to $276,000 in a showdown between two anonymous private collectors. These turned out to be Nic Cage and Leonardo DiCaprio, bidding anonymously over the phone, and Cage won. DiCaprio begged the seller for another skull, which he obligingly procured, mounted, and sold for an even higher price.

In 2012, though, the *Tarbosaurus* seller's luck ran out when he posted a complete skeleton for auction, priced at a cool million dollars. The scientific community and the Mongolian government rallied around this one specimen as the final straw, stopped the sale, repatriated the skeleton, and sent the smuggler to prison. This inspired a crackdown on other stolen fossils, resulting in many specimens being repatriated into Mongolia and China.

A much more detailed and sympathetic view of the fossil smuggling phenomenon, and a biography of the *Tarbosaurus* man in particular, can be found in the book "The Dinosaur Artist", by Paige Williams.
